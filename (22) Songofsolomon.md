#### ¹ The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s. 


#### ² Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; ² for your love is better than wine. ³ Your oils have a pleasing fragrance. ³ Your name is oil poured out, ³ therefore the virgins love you. ⁴ Take me away with you. ⁴ Let’s hurry. ⁴ The king has brought me into his rooms. ⁴ We will be glad and rejoice in you. ⁴ We will praise your love more than wine! ⁴ They are right to love you. ⁵ I am dark, but lovely, ⁵ you daughters of Jerusalem, ⁵ like Kedar’s tents, ⁵ like Solomon’s curtains. ⁶ Don’t stare at me because I am dark, ⁶ because the sun has scorched me. ⁶ My mother’s sons were angry with me. ⁶ They made me keeper of the vineyards. ⁶ I haven’t kept my own vineyard. ⁷ Tell me, you whom my soul loves, ⁷ where you graze your flock, ⁷ where you rest them at noon; ⁷ for why should I be as one who is veiled ⁷ beside the flocks of your companions? ⁸ If you don’t know, most beautiful among women, ⁸ follow the tracks of the sheep. ⁸ Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents. ⁹ I have compared you, my love, ⁹ to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. ¹⁰ Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, ¹⁰ your neck with strings of jewels. ¹¹ We will make you earrings of gold, ¹¹ with studs of silver. ¹² While the king sat at his table, ¹² my perfume spread its fragrance. ¹³ My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, ¹³ that lies between my breasts. ¹⁴ My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms ¹⁴ from the vineyards of En Gedi. ¹⁵ Behold, you are beautiful, my love. ¹⁵ Behold, you are beautiful. ¹⁵ Your eyes are like doves. ¹⁶ Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant; ¹⁶ and our couch is verdant. ¹⁷ The beams of our house are cedars. ¹⁷ Our rafters are firs. # Songofsolomon 2

#### ¹ I am a rose of Sharon, 
#### ¹ a lily of the valleys. ² As a lily among thorns, ² so is my love among the daughters. ³ As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, ³ so is my beloved among the sons. ³ I sat down under his shadow with great delight, ³ his fruit was sweet to my taste. ⁴ He brought me to the banquet hall. ⁴ His banner over me is love. ⁵ Strengthen me with raisins, ⁵ refresh me with apples; ⁵ for I am faint with love. ⁶ His left hand is under my head. ⁶ His right hand embraces me. ⁷ I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, ⁷ by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, ⁷ that you not stir up, nor awaken love, ⁷ until it so desires. ⁸ The voice of my beloved! ⁸ Behold, he comes, ⁸ leaping on the mountains, ⁸ skipping on the hills. ⁹ My beloved is like a roe or a young deer. ⁹ Behold, he stands behind our wall! ⁹ He looks in at the windows. ⁹ He glances through the lattice. ¹⁰ My beloved spoke, and said to me, ¹⁰ “Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away. ¹¹ For behold, the winter is past. ¹¹ The rain is over and gone. ¹² The flowers appear on the earth. ¹² The time of the singing has come, ¹² and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. ¹³ The fig tree ripens her green figs. ¹³ The vines are in blossom. ¹³ They give out their fragrance. ¹³ Arise, my love, my beautiful one, ¹³ and come away.” ¹⁴ My dove in the clefts of the rock, ¹⁴ in the hiding places of the mountainside, ¹⁴ let me see your face. ¹⁴ let me hear your voice; ¹⁴ for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely. ¹⁵ Catch for us the foxes, ¹⁵ the little foxes that plunder the vineyards; ¹⁵ for our vineyards are in blossom. ¹⁶ My beloved is mine, and I am his. ¹⁶ He browses among the lilies. ¹⁷ Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, ¹⁷ turn, my beloved, ¹⁷ and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether. # Songofsolomon 3

#### ¹ By night on my bed, 


#### ¹ I sought him whom my soul loves. 
#### ¹ I sought him, but I didn’t find him. ² I will get up now, and go about the city; ² in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves. ² I sought him, but I didn’t find him. ³ The watchmen who go about the city found me; ³ “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?” ⁴ I had scarcely passed from them, ⁴ when I found him whom my soul loves. ⁴ I held him, and would not let him go, ⁴ until I had brought him into my mother’s house, ⁴ into the room of her who conceived me. ⁵ I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, ⁵ by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, ⁵ that you not stir up nor awaken love, ⁵ until it so desires. ⁶ Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, ⁶ perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, ⁶ with all spices of the merchant? ⁷ Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage! ⁷ Sixty mighty men are around it, ⁷ of the mighty men of Israel. ⁸ They all handle the sword, and are expert in war. ⁸ Every man has his sword on his thigh, ⁸ because of fear in the night. ⁹ King Solomon made himself a carriage ⁹ of the wood of Lebanon. ¹⁰ He made its pillars of silver, ¹⁰ its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, ¹⁰ the middle of it being paved with love, ¹⁰ from the daughters of Jerusalem. ¹¹ Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon, ¹¹ with the crown with which his mother has crowned him, ¹¹ in the day of his weddings, ¹¹ in the day of the gladness of his heart. # Songofsolomon 4

#### ¹ Behold, you are beautiful, my love. 


#### ¹ Behold, you are beautiful. 
#### ¹ Your eyes are like doves behind your veil. 
#### ¹ Your hair is as a flock of goats, 
#### ¹ that descend from Mount Gilead. ² Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, ² which have come up from the washing, ² where every one of them has twins. ² None is bereaved among them. ³ Your lips are like scarlet thread. ³ Your mouth is lovely. ³ Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. ⁴ Your neck is like David’s tower built for an armory, ⁴ on which a thousand shields hang, ⁴ all the shields of the mighty men. ⁵ Your two breasts are like two fawns ⁵ that are twins of a roe, ⁵ which feed among the lilies. ⁶ Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, ⁶ I will go to the mountain of myrrh, ⁶ to the hill of frankincense. ⁷ You are all beautiful, my love. ⁷ There is no spot in you. ⁸ Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, ⁸ with me from Lebanon. ⁸ Look from the top of Amana, ⁸ from the top of Senir and Hermon, ⁸ from the lions’ dens, ⁸ from the mountains of the leopards. ⁹ You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride. ⁹ You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, ⁹ with one chain of your neck. ¹⁰ How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! ¹⁰ How much better is your love than wine, ¹⁰ the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices! ¹¹ Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb. ¹¹ Honey and milk are under your tongue. ¹¹ The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon. ¹² My sister, my bride, is a locked up garden; ¹² a locked up spring, ¹² a sealed fountain. ¹³ Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits, ¹³ henna with spikenard plants, ¹⁴ spikenard and saffron, ¹⁴ calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree; ¹⁴ myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices, ¹⁵ a fountain of gardens, ¹⁵ a well of living waters, ¹⁵ flowing streams from Lebanon. ¹⁶ Awake, north wind, and come, you south! ¹⁶ Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. ¹⁶ Let my beloved come into his garden, ¹⁶ and taste his precious fruits. # Songofsolomon 5

#### ¹ I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. 
#### ¹ I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; 
#### ¹ I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; 
#### ¹ I have drunk my wine with my milk. 
#### ¹ Eat, friends! 
#### ¹ Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved. ² I was asleep, but my heart was awake. ² It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: ² “Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; ² for my head is filled with dew, ² and my hair with the dampness of the night.” ³ I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? ³ I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them? ⁴ My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. ⁴ My heart pounded for him. ⁵ I rose up to open for my beloved. ⁵ My hands dripped with myrrh, ⁵ my fingers with liquid myrrh, ⁵ on the handles of the lock. ⁶ I opened to my beloved; ⁶ but my beloved left, and had gone away. ⁶ My heart went out when he spoke. ⁶ I looked for him, but I didn’t find him. ⁶ I called him, but he didn’t answer. ⁷ The watchmen who go about the city found me. ⁷ They beat me. ⁷ They bruised me. ⁷ The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me. ⁸ I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, ⁸ If you find my beloved, ⁸ that you tell him that I am faint with love. ⁹ How is your beloved better than another beloved, ⁹ you fairest among women? ⁹ How is your beloved better than another beloved, ⁹ that you do so adjure us? ¹⁰ My beloved is white and ruddy. ¹⁰ The best among ten thousand. ¹¹ His head is like the purest gold. ¹¹ His hair is bushy, black as a raven. ¹² His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, ¹² washed with milk, mounted like jewels. ¹³ His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. ¹³ His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. ¹⁴ His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. ¹⁴ His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires. ¹⁵ His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. ¹⁵ His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. ¹⁶ His mouth is sweetness; ¹⁶ yes, he is altogether lovely. ¹⁶ This is my beloved, and this is my friend, ¹⁶ daughters of Jerusalem. # Songofsolomon 6

#### ¹ Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women? 
#### ¹ Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you? ² My beloved has gone down to his garden, ² to the beds of spices, ² to pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies. ³ I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine. ³ He browses among the lilies. ⁴ You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, ⁴ lovely as Jerusalem, ⁴ awesome as an army with banners. ⁵ Turn away your eyes from me, ⁵ for they have overcome me. ⁵ Your hair is like a flock of goats, ⁵ that lie along the side of Gilead. ⁶ Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, ⁶ which have come up from the washing, ⁶ of which every one has twins; ⁶ not one is bereaved among them. ⁷ Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. ⁸ There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, ⁸ and virgins without number. ⁹ My dove, my perfect one, is unique. ⁹ She is her mother’s only daughter. ⁹ She is the favorite one of her who bore her. ⁹ The daughters saw her, and called her blessed. ⁹ The queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her. ¹⁰ Who is she who looks out as the morning, ¹⁰ beautiful as the moon, ¹⁰ clear as the sun, ¹⁰ and awesome as an army with banners? ¹¹ I went down into the nut tree grove, ¹¹ to see the green plants of the valley, ¹¹ to see whether the vine budded, ¹¹ and the pomegranates were in flower. ¹² Without realizing it, ¹² my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots. ¹³ Return, return, Shulammite! ¹³ Return, return, that we may gaze at you. ¹³ Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, ¹³ as at the dance of Mahanaim? # Songofsolomon 7

#### ¹ How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter! 


#### ¹ Your rounded thighs are like jewels, 
#### ¹ the work of the hands of a skillful workman. ² Your body is like a round goblet, ² no mixed wine is wanting. ² Your waist is like a heap of wheat, ² set about with lilies. ³ Your two breasts are like two fawns, ³ that are twins of a roe. ⁴ Your neck is like an ivory tower. ⁴ Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim. ⁴ Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus. ⁵ Your head on you is like Carmel. ⁵ The hair of your head like purple. ⁵ The king is held captive in its tresses. ⁶ How beautiful and how pleasant you are, ⁶ love, for delights! ⁷ This, your stature, is like a palm tree, ⁷ your breasts like its fruit. ⁸ I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree. ⁸ I will take hold of its fruit.” ⁸ Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, ⁸ the smell of your breath like apples. ⁹ Your mouth is like the best wine, ⁹ that goes down smoothly for my beloved, ⁹ gliding through the lips of those who are asleep. ¹⁰ I am my beloved’s. ¹⁰ His desire is toward me. ¹¹ Come, my beloved! Let’s go out into the field. ¹¹ Let’s lodge in the villages. ¹² Let’s go early up to the vineyards. ¹² Let’s see whether the vine has budded, ¹² its blossom is open, ¹² and the pomegranates are in flower. ¹² There I will give you my love. ¹³ The mandrakes produce fragrance. ¹³ At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old, ¹³ which I have stored up for you, my beloved. # Songofsolomon 8

#### ¹ Oh that you were like my brother, 


#### ¹ who nursed from the breasts of my mother! 
#### ¹ If I found you outside, I would kiss you; 
#### ¹ yes, and no one would despise me. ² I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother, ² who would instruct me. ² I would have you drink spiced wine, ² of the juice of my pomegranate. ³ His left hand would be under my head. ³ His right hand would embrace me. ⁴ I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, ⁴ that you not stir up, nor awaken love, ⁴ until it so desires. ⁵ Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, ⁵ leaning on her beloved? ⁵ Under the apple tree I aroused you. ⁵ There your mother conceived you. ⁵ There she was in labor and bore you. ⁶ Set me as a seal on your heart, ⁶ as a seal on your arm; ⁶ for love is strong as death. ⁶ Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol. ⁶ Its flashes are flashes of fire, ⁶ a very flame of Yahweh. ⁷ Many waters can’t quench love, ⁷ neither can floods drown it. ⁷ If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, ⁷ he would be utterly scorned. ⁸ We have a little sister. ⁸ She has no breasts. ⁸ What shall we do for our sister ⁸ in the day when she is to be spoken for? ⁹ If she is a wall, ⁹ we will build on her a turret of silver. ⁹ If she is a door, ⁹ we will enclose her with boards of cedar. ¹⁰ I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, ¹⁰ then I was in his eyes like one who found peace. ¹¹ Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. ¹¹ He leased out the vineyard to keepers. ¹¹ Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit. ¹² My own vineyard is before me. ¹² The thousand are for you, Solomon, ¹² two hundred for those who tend its fruit. ¹³ You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, ¹³ let me hear your voice! ¹⁴ Come away, my beloved! ¹⁴ Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!
