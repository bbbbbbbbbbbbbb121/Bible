# Joel 1

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. 


#### ² Hear this, you elders, ² And listen, all you inhabitants of the land. ² Has this ever happened in your days, ² or in the days of your fathers? ³ Tell your children about it, ³ and have your children tell their children, ³ and their children, another generation. ⁴ What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten. ⁴ What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten. ⁴ What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten. ⁵ Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! ⁵ Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; ⁵ for it is cut off from your mouth. ⁶ For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number. ⁶ His teeth are the teeth of a lion, ⁶ and he has the fangs of a lioness. ⁷ He has laid my vine waste, ⁷ and stripped my fig tree. ⁷ He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away. ⁷ Its branches are made white. ⁸ Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth! ⁹ The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house. ⁹ The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn. ¹⁰ The field is laid waste. ¹⁰ The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed, ¹⁰ The new wine has dried up, ¹⁰ and the oil languishes. ¹¹ Be confounded, you farmers! ¹¹ Wail, you vineyard keepers; ¹¹ for the wheat and for the barley; ¹¹ for the harvest of the field has perished. ¹² The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered; ¹² the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, ¹² even all of the trees of the field are withered; ¹² for joy has withered away from the sons of men. ¹³ Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests! ¹³ Wail, you ministers of the altar. ¹³ Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God, ¹³ for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house. ¹⁴ Sanctify a fast. ¹⁴ Call a solemn assembly. ¹⁴ Gather the elders, ¹⁴ and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of Yahweh, your God, ¹⁴ and cry to Yahweh. ¹⁵ Alas for the day! ¹⁵ For the day of Yahweh is at hand, ¹⁵ and it will come as destruction from the Almighty. ¹⁶ Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes; ¹⁶ joy and gladness from the house of our God? ¹⁷ The seeds rot under their clods. ¹⁷ The granaries are laid desolate. ¹⁷ The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered. ¹⁸ How the animals groan! ¹⁸ The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture. ¹⁸ Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. ¹⁹ Yahweh, I cry to you, ¹⁹ For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, ¹⁹ and the flame has burned all the trees of the field. ²⁰ Yes, the animals of the field pant to you, ²⁰ for the water brooks have dried up, ²⁰ And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness. # Joel 2

#### ¹ Blow the trumpet in Zion, 
#### ¹ and sound an alarm in my holy mountain! 
#### ¹ Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, 
#### ¹ for the day of Yahweh comes, 
#### ¹ for it is close at hand: ² A day of darkness and gloominess, ² a day of clouds and thick darkness. ² As the dawn spreading on the mountains, ² a great and strong people; ² there has never been the like, ² neither will there be any more after them, ² even to the years of many generations. ³ A fire devours before them, ³ and behind them, a flame burns. ³ The land is as the garden of Eden before them, ³ and behind them, a desolate wilderness. ³ Yes, and no one has escaped them. ⁴ Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, ⁴ and they run as horsemen. ⁵ Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap, ⁵ like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, ⁵ like a strong people set in battle array. ⁶ At their presence the peoples are in anguish. ⁶ All faces have grown pale. ⁷ They run like mighty men. ⁷ They climb the wall like warriors. ⁷ They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course. ⁸ Neither does one jostle another; ⁸ they march everyone in his path, ⁸ and they burst through the defenses, ⁸ and don’t break ranks. ⁹ They rush on the city. ⁹ They run on the wall. ⁹ They climb up into the houses. ⁹ They enter in at the windows like thieves. ¹⁰ The earth quakes before them. ¹⁰ The heavens tremble. ¹⁰ The sun and the moon are darkened, ¹⁰ and the stars withdraw their shining. ¹¹ Yahweh thunders his voice before his army; ¹¹ for his forces are very great; ¹¹ for he is strong who obeys his command; ¹¹ for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome, ¹¹ and who can endure it? ¹² “Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart, ¹² and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.” ¹³ Tear your heart, and not your garments, ¹³ and turn to Yahweh, your God; ¹³ for he is gracious and merciful, ¹³ slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, ¹³ and relents from sending calamity. ¹⁴ Who knows? He may turn and relent, ¹⁴ and leave a blessing behind him, ¹⁴ even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God. ¹⁵ Blow the trumpet in Zion! ¹⁵ Sanctify a fast. ¹⁵ Call a solemn assembly. ¹⁶ Gather the people. ¹⁶ Sanctify the assembly. ¹⁶ Assemble the elders. ¹⁶ Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts. ¹⁶ Let the bridegroom go out of his room, ¹⁶ and the bride out of her room. ¹⁷ Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, ¹⁷ and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh, ¹⁷ and don’t give your heritage to reproach, ¹⁷ that the nations should rule over them. ¹⁷ Why should they say among the peoples, ¹⁷ ‘Where is their God?’ ” ¹⁸ Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, ¹⁸ And had pity on his people. ¹⁹ Yahweh answered his people, ¹⁹ “Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, ¹⁹ and you will be satisfied with them; ¹⁹ and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. ²⁰ But I will remove the northern army far away from you, ²⁰ and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, ²⁰ its front into the eastern sea, ²⁰ and its back into the western sea; ²⁰ and its stench will come up, ²⁰ and its bad smell will rise.” ²⁰ Surely he has done great things. ²¹ Land, don’t be afraid. ²¹ Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things. ²² Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field; ²² for the pastures of the wilderness spring up, ²² for the tree bears its fruit. ²² The fig tree and the vine yield their strength. ²³ “Be glad then, you children of Zion, ²³ and rejoice in Yahweh, your God; ²³ for he gives you the early rain in just measure, ²³ and he causes the rain to come down for you, ²³ the early rain and the latter rain, ²³ as before. ²⁴ The threshing floors will be full of wheat, ²⁴ and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. ²⁵ I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, ²⁵ the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar, ²⁵ my great army, which I sent among you. ²⁶ You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied, ²⁶ and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God, ²⁶ who has dealt wondrously with you; ²⁶ and my people will never again be disappointed. ²⁷ You will know that I am among Israel, ²⁷ and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else; ²⁷ and my people will never again be disappointed. ²⁸ “It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; ²⁸ and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. ²⁸ Your old men will dream dreams. ²⁸ Your young men will see visions. ²⁹ And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days, ²⁹ I will pour out my Spirit. ³⁰ I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: ³⁰ blood, fire, and pillars of smoke. ³¹ The sun will be turned into darkness, ³¹ and the moon into blood, ³¹ before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes. ³² It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved; ³² for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, ³² as Yahweh has said, ³² and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls. # Joel 3

#### ¹ “For, behold, in those days, 
#### ¹ and in that time, 
#### ¹ when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, ² I will gather all nations, ² and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; ² and I will execute judgment on them there for my people, ² and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. ² They have divided my land, ³ and have cast lots for my people, ³ and have given a boy for a prostitute, ³ and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink. ⁴ “Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon, ⁴ and all the regions of Philistia? ⁴ Will you repay me? ⁴ And if you repay me, ⁴ I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head. ⁵ Because you have taken my silver and my gold, ⁵ and have carried my finest treasures into your temples, ⁶ and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, ⁶ that you may remove them far from their border. ⁷ Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them, ⁷ and will return your repayment on your own head; ⁸ and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah, ⁸ and they will sell them to the men of Sheba, ⁸ to a faraway nation, ⁸ for Yahweh has spoken it.” ⁹ Proclaim this among the nations: ⁹ “Prepare for war! ⁹ Stir up the mighty men. ⁹ Let all the warriors draw near. ⁹ Let them come up. ¹⁰ Beat your plowshares into swords, ¹⁰ and your pruning hooks into spears. ¹⁰ Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’ ¹¹ Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, ¹¹ and gather yourselves together.” ¹¹ Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh. ¹² “Let the nations arouse themselves, ¹² and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; ¹² for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. ¹³ Put in the sickle; ¹³ for the harvest is ripe. ¹³ Come, tread, for the wine press is full, ¹³ the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.” ¹⁴ Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! ¹⁴ For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision. ¹⁵ The sun and the moon are darkened, ¹⁵ and the stars withdraw their shining. ¹⁶ Yahweh will roar from Zion, ¹⁶ and thunder from Jerusalem; ¹⁶ and the heavens and the earth will shake; ¹⁶ but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people, ¹⁶ and a stronghold to the children of Israel. ¹⁷ “So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God, ¹⁷ dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. ¹⁷ Then Jerusalem will be holy, ¹⁷ and no strangers will pass through her any more. ¹⁸ It will happen in that day, ¹⁸ that the mountains will drop down sweet wine, ¹⁸ the hills will flow with milk, ¹⁸ all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters, ¹⁸ and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house, ¹⁸ and will water the valley of Shittim. ¹⁹ Egypt will be a desolation, ¹⁹ and Edom will be a desolate wilderness, ¹⁹ for the violence done to the children of Judah, ¹⁹ because they have shed innocent blood in their land. ²⁰ But Judah will be inhabited forever, ²⁰ and Jerusalem from generation to generation. ²¹ I will cleanse their blood, ²¹ that I have not cleansed: ²¹ for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”
