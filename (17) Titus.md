# Titus 1

#### ¹ Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, ² in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; ³ but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior; ⁴ to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lᴏʀᴅ Jesus Christ our Savior. 


#### ⁵ I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you, ⁶ if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior. ⁷ For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; ⁸ but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, ⁹ holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him. 


#### ¹⁰ For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, ¹¹ whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. ¹² One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” ¹³ This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, ¹⁴ not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. ¹⁵ To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. ¹⁶ They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. 

# Titus 2

#### ¹ But say the things which fit sound doctrine, ² that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance: ³ and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, ⁴ that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children, ⁵ to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. ⁶ Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. ⁷ In all things be showing yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, be showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, ⁸ and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. ⁹ Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, ¹⁰ not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things. ¹¹ For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, ¹² instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; ¹³ looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, ¹⁴ who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. 


#### ¹⁵ Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you. 

# Titus 3

#### ¹ Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, ² to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. ³ For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. ⁴ But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, ⁵ not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, ⁶ whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; ⁷ that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. ⁸ This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; ⁹ but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. ¹⁰ Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, ¹¹ knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned. 


#### ¹² When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. ¹³ Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. ¹⁴ Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. 


#### ¹⁵ All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
