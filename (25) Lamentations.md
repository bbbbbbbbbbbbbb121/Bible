#### ¹ How the city sits solitary, 


#### ¹ that was full of people! 
#### ¹ She has become as a widow, 
#### ¹ who was great among the nations! 
#### ¹ She who was a princess among the provinces 
#### ¹ has become a slave! 
#### ² She weeps bitterly in the night. ² Her tears are on her cheeks. ² Among all her lovers ² she has no one to comfort her. ² All her friends have dealt treacherously with her. ² They have become her enemies. ³ Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction, ³ and because of great servitude. ³ She dwells among the nations. ³ She finds no rest. ³ All her persecutors overtook her within the straits. ⁴ The roads to Zion mourn, ⁴ because no one comes to the solemn assembly. ⁴ All her gates are desolate. ⁴ Her priests sigh. ⁴ Her virgins are afflicted, ⁴ and she herself is in bitterness. ⁵ Her adversaries have become the head. ⁵ Her enemies prosper; ⁵ for Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. ⁵ Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary. ⁶ All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion. ⁶ Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture. ⁶ They have gone without strength before the pursuer. ⁷ Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries ⁷ all her pleasant things that were from the days of old; ⁷ when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, ⁷ and no one helped her. ⁷ The adversaries saw her. ⁷ They mocked at her desolations. ⁸ Jerusalem has grievously sinned. ⁸ Therefore she has become unclean. ⁸ All who honored her despise her, ⁸ because they have seen her nakedness. ⁸ Yes, she sighs, and turns backward. ⁹ Her filthiness was in her skirts. ⁹ She didn’t remember her latter end. ⁹ Therefore she has come down astoundingly. ⁹ She has no comforter. ⁹ “See, Yahweh, my affliction; ⁹ for the enemy has magnified himself.” ¹⁰ The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things; ¹⁰ for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary, ¹⁰ concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly. ¹¹ All her people sigh. ¹¹ They seek bread. ¹¹ They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul. ¹¹ “Look, Yahweh, and see; ¹¹ for I have become despised.” ¹² “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? ¹² Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, ¹² which is brought on me, ¹² with which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. ¹³ “From on high has he sent fire into my bones, ¹³ and it prevails against them. ¹³ He has spread a net for my feet. ¹³ He has turned me back. ¹³ He has made me desolate and I faint all day long. ¹⁴ “The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand. ¹⁴ They are knit together. ¹⁴ They have come up on my neck. ¹⁴ He made my strength fail. ¹⁴ The Lᴏʀᴅ has delivered me into their hands, ¹⁴ against whom I am not able to stand. ¹⁵ “The Lᴏʀᴅ has set at nothing all my mighty men within me. ¹⁵ He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men. ¹⁵ The Lᴏʀᴅ has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press. ¹⁶ “For these things I weep. ¹⁶ My eye, my eye runs down with water, ¹⁶ because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me. ¹⁶ My children are desolate, ¹⁶ because the enemy has prevailed.” ¹⁷ Zion spreads out her hands. ¹⁷ There is no one to comfort her. ¹⁷ Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, ¹⁷ that those who are around him should be his adversaries. ¹⁷ Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing. ¹⁸ “Yahweh is righteous; ¹⁸ for I have rebelled against his commandment. ¹⁸ Please hear all you peoples, ¹⁸ and see my sorrow. ¹⁸ My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity. ¹⁹ “I called for my lovers, ¹⁹ but they deceived me. ¹⁹ My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city, ¹⁹ while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls. ²⁰ “Look, Yahweh; for I am in distress. ²⁰ My heart is troubled. ²⁰ My heart turns over within me, ²⁰ for I have grievously rebelled. ²⁰ Abroad, the sword bereaves. ²⁰ At home, it is like death. ²¹ “They have heard that I sigh. ²¹ There is no one to comfort me. ²¹ All my enemies have heard of my trouble. ²¹ They are glad that you have done it. ²¹ You will bring the day that you have proclaimed, ²¹ and they will be like me. ²² “Let all their wickedness come before you. ²² Do to them as you have done to me for all my transgressions. ²² For my sighs are many, ²² and my heart is faint. # Lamentations 2

#### ¹ How has the Lᴏʀᴅ covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! 


#### ¹ He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth, 
#### ¹ and hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. 
#### ² The Lᴏʀᴅ has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob ² without pity. ² He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. ² He has brought them down to the ground. ² He has profaned the kingdom and its princes. ³ He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger. ³ He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy. ³ He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, ³ which devours all around. ⁴ He has bent his bow like an enemy. ⁴ He has stood with his right hand as an adversary. ⁴ Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye. ⁴ In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire. ⁵ The Lᴏʀᴅ has become as an enemy. ⁵ He has swallowed up Israel. ⁵ He has swallowed up all her palaces. ⁵ He has destroyed his strongholds. ⁵ He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah. ⁶ He has violently taken away his tabernacle, ⁶ as if it were of a garden. ⁶ He has destroyed his place of assembly. ⁶ Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion. ⁶ In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest. ⁷ The Lᴏʀᴅ has cast off his altar. ⁷ He has abhorred his sanctuary. ⁷ He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. ⁷ They have made a noise in Yahweh’s house, ⁷ as in the day of a solemn assembly. ⁸ Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. ⁸ He has stretched out the line. ⁸ He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying; ⁸ He has made the rampart and wall lament. ⁸ They languish together. ⁹ Her gates have sunk into the ground. ⁹ He has destroyed and broken her bars. ⁹ Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not. ⁹ Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh. ¹⁰ The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground. ¹⁰ They keep silence. ¹⁰ They have cast up dust on their heads. ¹⁰ They have clothed themselves with sackcloth. ¹⁰ The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. ¹¹ My eyes fail with tears. ¹¹ My heart is troubled. ¹¹ My liver is poured on the earth, ¹¹ because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, ¹¹ because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city. ¹² They ask their mothers, ¹² “Where is grain and wine?” ¹² when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, ¹² when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom. ¹³ What shall I testify to you? ¹³ What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem? ¹³ What shall I compare to you, ¹³ that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion? ¹³ For your breach is as big as the sea. ¹³ Who can heal you? ¹⁴ Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you. ¹⁴ They have not uncovered your iniquity, ¹⁴ to reverse your captivity, ¹⁴ but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment. ¹⁵ All that pass by clap their hands at you. ¹⁵ They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, ¹⁵ “Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty, ¹⁵ the joy of the whole earth’?” ¹⁶ All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you. ¹⁶ They hiss and gnash their teeth. ¹⁶ They say, “We have swallowed her up. ¹⁶ Certainly this is the day that we looked for. ¹⁶ We have found it. ¹⁶ We have seen it.” ¹⁷ Yahweh has done that which he planned. ¹⁷ He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old. ¹⁷ He has thrown down, ¹⁷ and has not pitied. ¹⁷ He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you. ¹⁷ He has exalted the horn of your adversaries. ¹⁸ Their heart cried to the Lᴏʀᴅ. ¹⁸ O wall of the daughter of Zion, ¹⁸ let tears run down like a river day and night. ¹⁸ Give yourself no relief. ¹⁸ Don’t let the your eyes rest. ¹⁹ Arise, cry out in the night, ¹⁹ at the beginning of the watches! ¹⁹ Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lᴏʀᴅ. ¹⁹ Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, ¹⁹ who faint for hunger at the head of every street. ²⁰ “Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus! ²⁰ Should the women eat their offspring, ²⁰ the children that they held and bounced on their knees? ²⁰ Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lᴏʀᴅ? ²¹ “The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets. ²¹ My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. ²¹ You have killed them in the day of your anger. ²¹ You have slaughtered, and not pitied. ²² “You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side. ²² There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh’s anger. ²² My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up. # Lamentations 3

#### ¹ I am the man who has seen affliction 
#### ¹ by the rod of his wrath. ² He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, ² and not in light. ³ Surely he turns his hand against me ³ again and again all day long. ⁴ He has made my flesh and my skin old. ⁴ He has broken my bones. ⁵ He has built against me, ⁵ and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. ⁶ He has made me dwell in dark places, ⁶ as those who have been long dead. ⁷ He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out. ⁷ He has made my chain heavy. ⁸ Yes, when I cry, and call for help, ⁸ he shuts out my prayer. ⁹ He has walled up my ways with cut stone. ⁹ He has made my paths crooked. ¹⁰ He is to me as a bear lying in wait, ¹⁰ as a lion in secret places. ¹¹ He has turned away my ways, ¹¹ and pulled me in pieces. ¹¹ He has made me desolate. ¹² He has bent his bow, ¹² and set me as a mark for the arrow. ¹³ He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys. ¹⁴ I have become a derision to all my people, ¹⁴ and their song all day long. ¹⁵ He has filled me with bitterness. ¹⁵ He has stuffed me with wormwood. ¹⁶ He has also broken my teeth with gravel. ¹⁶ He has covered me with ashes. ¹⁷ You have removed my soul far away from peace. ¹⁷ I forgot prosperity. ¹⁸ I said, “My strength has perished, ¹⁸ along with my expectation from Yahweh.” ¹⁹ Remember my affliction and my misery, ¹⁹ the wormwood and the bitterness. ²⁰ My soul still remembers them, ²⁰ and is bowed down within me. ²¹ This I recall to my mind; ²¹ therefore I have hope. ²² It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, ²² because his compassion doesn’t fail. ²³ They are new every morning. ²³ Great is your faithfulness. ²⁴ “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul. ²⁴ “Therefore I will hope in him.” ²⁵ Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, ²⁵ to the soul who seeks him. ²⁶ It is good that a man should hope ²⁶ and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh. ²⁷ It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. ²⁸ Let him sit alone and keep silence, ²⁸ because he has laid it on him. ²⁹ Let him put his mouth in the dust, ²⁹ if it is so that there may be hope. ³⁰ Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him. ³⁰ Let him be filled full of reproach. ³¹ For the Lᴏʀᴅ will not cast off forever. ³² For though he causes grief, ³² yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. ³³ For he does not afflict willingly, ³³ nor grieve the children of men. ³⁴ To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, ³⁵ to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High, ³⁶ to subvert a man in his cause, the Lᴏʀᴅ doesn’t approve. ³⁷ Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, ³⁷ when the Lᴏʀᴅ doesn’t command it? ³⁸ Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High? ³⁹ Why does a living man complain, ³⁹ a man for the punishment of his sins? ⁴⁰ Let us search and try our ways, ⁴⁰ and turn again to Yahweh. ⁴¹ Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens. ⁴² “We have transgressed and have rebelled. ⁴² You have not pardoned. ⁴³ “You have covered us with anger and pursued us. ⁴³ You have killed. ⁴³ You have not pitied. ⁴⁴ You have covered yourself with a cloud, ⁴⁴ so that no prayer can pass through. ⁴⁵ You have made us an off-scouring and refuse ⁴⁵ in the middle of the peoples. ⁴⁶ “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. ⁴⁷ Terror and the pit have come on us, ⁴⁷ devastation and destruction.” ⁴⁸ My eye runs down with streams of water, ⁴⁸ for the destruction of the daughter of my people. ⁴⁹ My eye pours down ⁴⁹ and doesn’t cease, ⁴⁹ without any intermission, ⁵⁰ until Yahweh looks down, ⁵⁰ and sees from heaven. ⁵¹ My eye affects my soul, ⁵¹ because of all the daughters of my city. ⁵² They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, ⁵² those who are my enemies without cause. ⁵³ They have cut off my life in the dungeon, ⁵³ and have cast a stone on me. ⁵⁴ Waters flowed over my head. ⁵⁴ I said, “I am cut off.” ⁵⁵ I called on your name, Yahweh, ⁵⁵ out of the lowest dungeon. ⁵⁶ You heard my voice: ⁵⁶ “Don’t hide your ear from my sighing, ⁵⁶ and my cry.” ⁵⁷ You came near in the day that I called on you. ⁵⁷ You said, “Don’t be afraid.” ⁵⁸ Lᴏʀᴅ, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. ⁵⁸ You have redeemed my life. ⁵⁹ Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. ⁵⁹ Judge my cause. ⁶⁰ You have seen all their vengeance ⁶⁰ and all their plans against me. ⁶¹ You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, ⁶¹ and all their plans against me, ⁶² the lips of those that rose up against me, ⁶² and their plots against me all day long. ⁶³ You see their sitting down and their rising up. ⁶³ I am their song. ⁶⁴ You will pay them back, Yahweh, ⁶⁴ according to the work of their hands. ⁶⁵ You will give them hardness of heart, ⁶⁵ your curse to them. ⁶⁶ You will pursue them in anger, ⁶⁶ and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh. # Lamentations 4

#### ¹ How the gold has become dim! 
#### ¹ The most pure gold has changed! 
#### ¹ The stones of the sanctuary are poured out 
#### ¹ at the head of every street. 
#### ² The precious sons of Zion, ² comparable to fine gold, ² how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers, ² the work of the hands of the potter! ³ Even the jackals offer their breast. ³ They nurse their young ones. ³ But the daughter of my people has become cruel, ³ like the ostriches in the wilderness. ⁴ The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst. ⁴ The young children ask bread, ⁴ and no one breaks it for them. ⁵ Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets. ⁵ Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills. ⁶ For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, ⁶ which was overthrown as in a moment. ⁶ No hands were laid on her. ⁷ Her nobles were purer than snow. ⁷ They were whiter than milk. ⁷ They were more ruddy in body than rubies. ⁷ Their polishing was like sapphire. ⁸ Their appearance is blacker than a coal. ⁸ They are not known in the streets. ⁸ Their skin clings to their bones. ⁸ It is withered. ⁸ It has become like a stick. ⁹ Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger; ⁹ For these pine away, stricken through, ⁹ for lack of the fruits of the field. ¹⁰ The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children. ¹⁰ They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people. ¹¹ Yahweh has accomplished his wrath. ¹¹ He has poured out his fierce anger. ¹¹ He has kindled a fire in Zion, ¹¹ which has devoured its foundations. ¹² The kings of the earth didn’t believe, ¹² neither did all the inhabitants of the world, ¹² that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem. ¹³ It is because of the sins of her prophets ¹³ and the iniquities of her priests, ¹³ That have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her. ¹⁴ They wander as blind men in the streets. ¹⁴ They are polluted with blood, ¹⁴ So that men can’t touch their garments. ¹⁵ “Go away!” they cried to them. ¹⁵ “Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch! ¹⁵ When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, ¹⁵ “They can’t live here any more.” ¹⁶ Yahweh’s anger has scattered them. ¹⁶ He will not pay attention to them any more. ¹⁶ They didn’t respect the persons of the priests. ¹⁶ They didn’t favor the elders. ¹⁷ Our eyes still fail, ¹⁷ looking in vain for our help. ¹⁷ In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save. ¹⁸ They hunt our steps, ¹⁸ so that we can’t go in our streets. ¹⁸ Our end is near. ¹⁸ Our days are fulfilled, ¹⁸ for our end has come. ¹⁹ Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky. ¹⁹ They chased us on the mountains. ¹⁹ They set an ambush for us in the wilderness. ²⁰ The breath of our nostrils, ²⁰ the anointed of Yahweh, ²⁰ was taken in their pits; ²⁰ of whom we said, ²⁰ under his shadow we will live among the nations. ²¹ Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, ²¹ that dwells in the land of Uz. ²¹ The cup will pass through to you also. ²¹ You will be drunken, ²¹ and will make yourself naked. ²² The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion. ²² He will no more carry you away into captivity. ²² He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom. ²² He will uncover your sins. # Lamentations 5

#### ¹ Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us. 
#### ¹ Look, and see our reproach. ² Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, ² our houses to aliens. ³ We are orphans and fatherless. ³ Our mothers are as widows. ⁴ We have drunken our water for money. ⁴ Our wood is sold to us. ⁵ Our pursuers are on our necks. ⁵ We are weary, and have no rest. ⁶ We have given our hands to the Egyptians, ⁶ and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. ⁷ Our fathers sinned, and are no more. ⁷ We have borne their iniquities. ⁸ Servants rule over us. ⁸ There is no one to deliver us out of their hand. ⁹ We get our bread at the peril of our lives, ⁹ because of the sword of the wilderness. ¹⁰ Our skin is black like an oven, ¹⁰ because of the burning heat of famine. ¹¹ They ravished the women in Zion, ¹¹ the virgins in the cities of Judah. ¹² Princes were hanged up by their hands. ¹² The faces of elders were not honored. ¹³ The young men carry millstones. ¹³ The children stumbled under loads of wood. ¹⁴ The elders have ceased from the gate, ¹⁴ and the young men from their music. ¹⁵ The joy of our heart has ceased. ¹⁵ Our dance is turned into mourning. ¹⁶ The crown has fallen from our head. ¹⁶ Woe to us, for we have sinned! ¹⁷ For this our heart is faint. ¹⁷ For these things our eyes are dim. ¹⁸ For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate. ¹⁸ The foxes walk on it. ¹⁹ You, Yahweh, remain forever. ¹⁹ Your throne is from generation to generation. ²⁰ Why do you forget us forever, ²⁰ and forsake us for so long a time? ²¹ Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned. ²¹ Renew our days as of old. ²² But you have utterly rejected us. ²² You are very angry against us.
