# 2 Timothy 1

#### ¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, ² to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lᴏʀᴅ. 


#### ³ I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day ⁴ longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; ⁵ having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also. 


#### ⁶ For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. ⁷ For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. ⁸ Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lᴏʀᴅ, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, ⁹ who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, ¹⁰ but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. ¹¹ For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. ¹² For this cause I also suffer these things. 


#### ¹² Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. 


#### ¹³ Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. ¹⁴ That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. 


#### ¹⁵ This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. ¹⁶ May the Lᴏʀᴅ grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, ¹⁷ but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me ¹⁸ (the Lᴏʀᴅ grant to him to find the Lᴏʀᴅ’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well. 

# 2 Timothy 2

#### ¹ You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. ² The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. ³ You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. ⁴ No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. ⁵ Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. ⁶ The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. ⁷ Consider what I say, and may the Lᴏʀᴅ give you understanding in all things. 


#### ⁸ Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of David, according to my Good News, ⁹ in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. ¹⁰ Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. ¹¹ This saying is trustworthy: 

¹¹ “For if we died with him, ¹¹ we will also live with him. ¹² If we endure, ¹² we will also reign with him. ¹² If we deny him, ¹² he also will deny us. ¹³ If we are faithless, ¹³ he remains faithful; ¹³ for he can’t deny himself.” 
#### ¹⁴ Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lᴏʀᴅ, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. 


#### ¹⁵ Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. ¹⁶ But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, ¹⁷ and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: ¹⁸ men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. ¹⁹ However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lᴏʀᴅ knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ depart from unrighteousness.” ²⁰ Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor. ²¹ If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work. 


#### ²² Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lᴏʀᴅ out of a pure heart. ²³ But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. ²⁴ The Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient, ²⁵ in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, ²⁶ and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will. 

# 2 Timothy 3

#### ¹ But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. ² For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, ³ without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, ⁴ traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, ⁵ holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. ⁶ For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, ⁷ always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. ⁸ Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. ⁹ But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. ¹⁰ But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, ¹¹ persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lᴏʀᴅ delivered me out of them all. ¹² Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. ¹³ But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. ¹⁴ But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. ¹⁵ From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. ¹⁶ Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, ¹⁷ that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 

# 2 Timothy 4

#### ¹ I command you therefore before God and the Lᴏʀᴅ Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: ² preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. ³ For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, ⁴ and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. ⁵ But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. 


#### ⁶ For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. ⁷ I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. ⁸ From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lᴏʀᴅ, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. 


#### ⁹ Be diligent to come to me soon, ¹⁰ for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. ¹¹ Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. ¹² But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. ¹³ Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. ¹⁴ Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lᴏʀᴅ will repay him according to his deeds, ¹⁵ of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. 


#### ¹⁶ At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. ¹⁷ But the Lᴏʀᴅ stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. ¹⁸ And the Lᴏʀᴅ will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 


#### ¹⁹ Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. ²⁰ Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. ²¹ Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 


#### ²² The Lᴏʀᴅ Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
