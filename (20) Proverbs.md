# Proverbs 1

#### ¹ The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: 


#### ² to know wisdom and instruction; ² to discern the words of understanding; ³ to receive instruction in wise dealing, ³ in righteousness, justice, and equity; ⁴ to give prudence to the simple, ⁴ knowledge and discretion to the young man: ⁵ that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; ⁵ that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel: ⁶ to understand a proverb, and parables, ⁶ the words and riddles of the wise. ⁷ The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; ⁷ but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. ⁸ My son, listen to your father’s instruction, ⁸ and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching: ⁹ for they will be a garland to grace your head, ⁹ and chains around your neck. ¹⁰ My son, if sinners entice you, ¹⁰ don’t consent. ¹¹ If they say, “Come with us. ¹¹ Let’s lay in wait for blood. ¹¹ Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause. ¹² Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol, ¹² and whole, like those who go down into the pit. ¹³ We’ll find all valuable wealth. ¹³ We’ll fill our houses with plunder. ¹⁴ You shall cast your lot among us. ¹⁴ We’ll all have one purse.” ¹⁵ My son, don’t walk on the path with them. ¹⁵ Keep your foot from their path, ¹⁶ for their feet run to evil. ¹⁶ They hurry to shed blood. ¹⁷ For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird; ¹⁸ but these lay in wait for their own blood. ¹⁸ They lurk secretly for their own lives. ¹⁹ So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. ¹⁹ It takes away the life of its owners. ²⁰ Wisdom calls aloud in the street. ²⁰ She utters her voice in the public squares. ²¹ She calls at the head of noisy places. ²¹ At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words: ²² “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? ²² How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, ²² and fools hate knowledge? ²³ Turn at my reproof. ²³ Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. ²³ I will make known my words to you. ²⁴ Because I have called, and you have refused; ²⁴ I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention; ²⁵ but you have ignored all my counsel, ²⁵ and wanted none of my reproof; ²⁶ I also will laugh at your disaster. ²⁶ I will mock when calamity overtakes you, ²⁷ when calamity overtakes you like a storm, ²⁷ when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, ²⁷ when distress and anguish come on you. ²⁸ Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. ²⁸ They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me; ²⁹ because they hated knowledge, ²⁹ and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh. ³⁰ They wanted none of my counsel. ³⁰ They despised all my reproof. ³¹ Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, ³¹ and be filled with their own schemes. ³² For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. ³² The careless ease of fools will destroy them. ³³ But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, ³³ and will be at ease, without fear of harm.” # Proverbs 2

#### ¹ My son, if you will receive my words, 
#### ¹ and store up my commandments within you, ² so as to turn your ear to wisdom, ² and apply your heart to understanding; ³ yes, if you call out for discernment, ³ and lift up your voice for understanding; ⁴ if you seek her as silver, ⁴ and search for her as for hidden treasures: ⁵ then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, ⁵ and find the knowledge of God. ⁶ For Yahweh gives wisdom. ⁶ Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. ⁷ He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. ⁷ He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, ⁸ that he may guard the paths of justice, ⁸ and preserve the way of his saints. ⁹ Then you will understand righteousness and justice, ⁹ equity and every good path. ¹⁰ For wisdom will enter into your heart. ¹⁰ Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. ¹¹ Discretion will watch over you. ¹¹ Understanding will keep you, ¹² to deliver you from the way of evil, ¹² from the men who speak perverse things, ¹³ who forsake the paths of uprightness, ¹³ to walk in the ways of darkness, ¹⁴ who rejoice to do evil, ¹⁴ and delight in the perverseness of evil, ¹⁵ who are crooked in their ways, ¹⁵ and wayward in their paths, ¹⁶ to deliver you from the strange woman, ¹⁶ even from the foreigner who flatters with her words, ¹⁷ who forsakes the friend of her youth, ¹⁷ and forgets the covenant of her God; ¹⁸ for her house leads down to death, ¹⁸ her paths to the departed spirits. ¹⁹ None who go to her return again, ¹⁹ neither do they attain to the paths of life. ²⁰ So you may walk in the way of good men, ²⁰ and keep the paths of the righteous. ²¹ For the upright will dwell in the land. ²¹ The perfect will remain in it. ²² But the wicked will be cut off from the land. ²² The treacherous will be rooted out of it. # Proverbs 3

#### ¹ My son, don’t forget my teaching; 
#### ¹ but let your heart keep my commandments: ² for they will add to you length of days, ² years of life, and peace. ³ Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. ³ Bind them around your neck. ³ Write them on the tablet of your heart. ⁴ So you will find favor, ⁴ and good understanding in the sight of God and man. ⁵ Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, ⁵ and don’t lean on your own understanding. ⁶ In all your ways acknowledge him, ⁶ and he will make your paths straight. ⁷ Don’t be wise in your own eyes. ⁷ Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil. ⁸ It will be health to your body, ⁸ and nourishment to your bones. ⁹ Honor Yahweh with your substance, ⁹ with the first fruits of all your increase: ¹⁰ so your barns will be filled with plenty, ¹⁰ and your vats will overflow with new wine. ¹¹ My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline, ¹¹ neither be weary of his correction; ¹² for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects, ¹² even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights. ¹³ Happy is the man who finds wisdom, ¹³ the man who gets understanding. ¹⁴ For her good profit is better than getting silver, ¹⁴ and her return is better than fine gold. ¹⁵ She is more precious than rubies. ¹⁵ None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her. ¹⁶ Length of days is in her right hand. ¹⁶ In her left hand are riches and honor. ¹⁷ Her ways are ways of pleasantness. ¹⁷ All her paths are peace. ¹⁸ She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. ¹⁸ Happy is everyone who retains her. ¹⁹ By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. ¹⁹ By understanding, he established the heavens. ²⁰ By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, ²⁰ and the skies drop down the dew. ²¹ My son, let them not depart from your eyes. ²¹ Keep sound wisdom and discretion: ²² so they will be life to your soul, ²² and grace for your neck. ²³ Then you shall walk in your way securely. ²³ Your foot won’t stumble. ²⁴ When you lie down, you will not be afraid. ²⁴ Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet. ²⁵ Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, ²⁵ neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes; ²⁶ for Yahweh will be your confidence, ²⁶ and will keep your foot from being taken. ²⁷ Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, ²⁷ when it is in the power of your hand to do it. ²⁸ Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; ²⁸ tomorrow I will give it to you,” ²⁸ when you have it by you. ²⁹ Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, ²⁹ since he dwells securely by you. ³⁰ Don’t strive with a man without cause, ³⁰ if he has done you no harm. ³¹ Don’t envy the man of violence. ³¹ Choose none of his ways. ³² For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, ³² but his friendship is with the upright. ³³ Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked, ³³ but he blesses the habitation of the righteous. ³⁴ Surely he mocks the mockers, ³⁴ but he gives grace to the humble. ³⁵ The wise will inherit glory, ³⁵ but shame will be the promotion of fools. # Proverbs 4

#### ¹ Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. 
#### ¹ Pay attention and know understanding; ² for I give you sound learning. ² Don’t forsake my law. ³ For I was a son to my father, ³ tender and an only child in the sight of my mother. ⁴ He taught me, and said to me: ⁴ “Let your heart retain my words. ⁴ Keep my commandments, and live. ⁵ Get wisdom. ⁵ Get understanding. ⁵ Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth. ⁶ Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. ⁶ Love her, and she will keep you. ⁷ Wisdom is supreme. ⁷ Get wisdom. ⁷ Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding. ⁸ Esteem her, and she will exalt you. ⁸ She will bring you to honor when you embrace her. ⁹ She will give to your head a garland of grace. ⁹ She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.” ¹⁰ Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. ¹⁰ The years of your life will be many. ¹¹ I have taught you in the way of wisdom. ¹¹ I have led you in straight paths. ¹² When you go, your steps will not be hampered. ¹² When you run, you will not stumble. ¹³ Take firm hold of instruction. ¹³ Don’t let her go. ¹³ Keep her, for she is your life. ¹⁴ Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. ¹⁴ Don’t walk in the way of evil men. ¹⁵ Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. ¹⁵ Turn from it, and pass on. ¹⁶ For they don’t sleep unless they do evil. ¹⁶ Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall. ¹⁷ For they eat the bread of wickedness ¹⁷ and drink the wine of violence. ¹⁸ But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light ¹⁸ that shines more and more until the perfect day. ¹⁹ The way of the wicked is like darkness. ¹⁹ They don’t know what they stumble over. ²⁰ My son, attend to my words. ²⁰ Turn your ear to my sayings. ²¹ Let them not depart from your eyes. ²¹ Keep them in the center of your heart. ²² For they are life to those who find them, ²² and health to their whole body. ²³ Keep your heart with all diligence, ²³ for out of it is the wellspring of life. ²⁴ Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. ²⁴ Put corrupt lips far from you. ²⁵ Let your eyes look straight ahead. ²⁵ Fix your gaze directly before you. ²⁶ Make the path of your feet level. ²⁶ Let all of your ways be established. ²⁷ Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. ²⁷ Remove your foot from evil. # Proverbs 5

#### ¹ My son, pay attention to my wisdom. 
#### ¹ Turn your ear to my understanding, ² that you may maintain discretion, ² that your lips may preserve knowledge. ³ For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. ³ Her mouth is smoother than oil, ⁴ but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, ⁴ and as sharp as a two-edged sword. ⁵ Her feet go down to death. ⁵ Her steps lead straight to Sheol. ⁶ She gives no thought to the way of life. ⁶ Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it. ⁷ Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. ⁷ Don’t depart from the words of my mouth. ⁸ Remove your way far from her. ⁸ Don’t come near the door of her house, ⁹ lest you give your honor to others, ⁹ and your years to the cruel one; ¹⁰ lest strangers feast on your wealth, ¹⁰ and your labors enrich another man’s house. ¹¹ You will groan at your latter end, ¹¹ when your flesh and your body are consumed, ¹² and say, “How I have hated instruction, ¹² and my heart despised reproof; ¹³ neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, ¹³ nor turned my ear to those who instructed me! ¹⁴ I have come to the brink of utter ruin, ¹⁴ among the gathered assembly.” ¹⁵ Drink water out of your own cistern, ¹⁵ running water out of your own well. ¹⁶ Should your springs overflow in the streets, ¹⁶ streams of water in the public squares? ¹⁷ Let them be for yourself alone, ¹⁷ not for strangers with you. ¹⁸ Let your spring be blessed. ¹⁸ Rejoice in the wife of your youth. ¹⁹ A loving doe and a graceful deer— ¹⁹ let her breasts satisfy you at all times. ¹⁹ Be captivated always with her love. ²⁰ For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? ²⁰ Why embrace the bosom of another? ²¹ For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes. ²¹ He examines all his paths. ²² The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. ²² The cords of his sin hold him firmly. ²³ He will die for lack of instruction. ²³ In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray. # Proverbs 6

#### ¹ My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, 
#### ¹ if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger, ² you are trapped by the words of your mouth; ² you are ensnared with the words of your mouth. ³ Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, ³ since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. ³ Go, humble yourself. ³ Press your plea with your neighbor. ⁴ Give no sleep to your eyes, ⁴ nor slumber to your eyelids. ⁵ Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, ⁵ like a bird from the snare of the fowler. ⁶ Go to the ant, you sluggard. ⁶ Consider her ways, and be wise; ⁷ which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, ⁸ provides her bread in the summer, ⁸ and gathers her food in the harvest. ⁹ How long will you sleep, sluggard? ⁹ When will you arise out of your sleep? ¹⁰ A little sleep, a little slumber, ¹⁰ a little folding of the hands to sleep: ¹¹ so your poverty will come as a robber, ¹¹ and your scarcity as an armed man. ¹² A worthless person, a man of iniquity, ¹² is he who walks with a perverse mouth, ¹³ who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, ¹³ who motions with his fingers, ¹⁴ in whose heart is perverseness, ¹⁴ who devises evil continually, ¹⁴ who always sows discord. ¹⁵ Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. ¹⁵ He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy. ¹⁶ There are six things which Yahweh hates; ¹⁶ yes, seven which are an abomination to him: ¹⁷ arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, ¹⁷ hands that shed innocent blood, ¹⁸ a heart that devises wicked schemes, ¹⁸ feet that are swift in running to mischief, ¹⁹ a false witness who utters lies, ¹⁹ and he who sows discord among brothers. ²⁰ My son, keep your father’s commandment, ²⁰ and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching. ²¹ Bind them continually on your heart. ²¹ Tie them around your neck. ²² When you walk, it will lead you. ²² When you sleep, it will watch over you. ²² When you awake, it will talk with you. ²³ For the commandment is a lamp, ²³ and the law is light. ²³ Reproofs of instruction are the way of life, ²⁴ to keep you from the immoral woman, ²⁴ from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue. ²⁵ Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart, ²⁵ neither let her captivate you with her eyelids. ²⁶ For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. ²⁶ The adulteress hunts for your precious life. ²⁷ Can a man scoop fire into his lap, ²⁷ and his clothes not be burned? ²⁸ Or can one walk on hot coals, ²⁸ and his feet not be scorched? ²⁹ So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife. ²⁹ Whoever touches her will not be unpunished. ³⁰ Men don’t despise a thief ³⁰ if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry; ³¹ but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. ³¹ He shall give all the wealth of his house. ³² He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. ³² He who does it destroys his own soul. ³³ He will get wounds and dishonor. ³³ His reproach will not be wiped away. ³⁴ For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. ³⁴ He won’t spare in the day of vengeance. ³⁵ He won’t regard any ransom, ³⁵ neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts. # Proverbs 7

#### ¹ My son, keep my words. 
#### ¹ Lay up my commandments within you. ² Keep my commandments and live! ² Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye. ³ Bind them on your fingers. ³ Write them on the tablet of your heart. ⁴ Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.” ⁴ Call understanding your relative, ⁵ that they may keep you from the strange woman, ⁵ from the foreigner who flatters with her words. ⁶ For at the window of my house, ⁶ I looked out through my lattice. ⁷ I saw among the simple ones. ⁷ I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding, ⁸ passing through the street near her corner, ⁸ he went the way to her house, ⁹ in the twilight, in the evening of the day, ⁹ in the middle of the night and in the darkness. ¹⁰ Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, ¹⁰ and with crafty intent. ¹¹ She is loud and defiant. ¹¹ Her feet don’t stay in her house. ¹² Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, ¹² and lurking at every corner. ¹³ So she caught him, and kissed him. ¹³ With an impudent face she said to him: ¹⁴ “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. ¹⁴ Today I have paid my vows. ¹⁵ Therefore I came out to meet you, ¹⁵ to diligently seek your face, ¹⁵ and I have found you. ¹⁶ I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, ¹⁶ with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. ¹⁷ I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. ¹⁸ Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning. ¹⁸ Let’s solace ourselves with loving. ¹⁹ For my husband isn’t at home. ¹⁹ He has gone on a long journey. ²⁰ He has taken a bag of money with him. ²⁰ He will come home at the full moon.” ²¹ With persuasive words, she led him astray. ²¹ With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him. ²² He followed her immediately, ²² as an ox goes to the slaughter, ²² as a fool stepping into a noose. ²³ Until an arrow strikes through his liver, ²³ as a bird hurries to the snare, ²³ and doesn’t know that it will cost his life. ²⁴ Now therefore, sons, listen to me. ²⁴ Pay attention to the words of my mouth. ²⁵ Don’t let your heart turn to her ways. ²⁵ Don’t go astray in her paths, ²⁶ for she has thrown down many wounded. ²⁶ Yes, all her slain are a mighty army. ²⁷ Her house is the way to Sheol, ²⁷ going down to the rooms of death. # Proverbs 8

#### ¹ Doesn’t wisdom cry out? 
#### ¹ Doesn’t understanding raise her voice? ² On the top of high places by the way, ² where the paths meet, she stands. ³ Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, ³ at the entry doors, she cries aloud: ⁴ “I call to you men! ⁴ I send my voice to the sons of mankind. ⁵ You simple, understand prudence! ⁵ You fools, be of an understanding heart! ⁶ Hear, for I will speak excellent things. ⁶ The opening of my lips is for right things. ⁷ For my mouth speaks truth. ⁷ Wickedness is an abomination to my lips. ⁸ All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. ⁸ There is nothing crooked or perverse in them. ⁹ They are all plain to him who understands, ⁹ right to those who find knowledge. ¹⁰ Receive my instruction rather than silver, ¹⁰ knowledge rather than choice gold. ¹¹ For wisdom is better than rubies. ¹¹ All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it. ¹² “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling. ¹² Find out knowledge and discretion. ¹³ The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil. ¹³ I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth. ¹⁴ Counsel and sound knowledge are mine. ¹⁴ I have understanding and power. ¹⁵ By me kings reign, ¹⁵ and princes decree justice. ¹⁶ By me princes rule, ¹⁶ nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth. ¹⁷ I love those who love me. ¹⁷ Those who seek me diligently will find me. ¹⁸ With me are riches, honor, ¹⁸ enduring wealth, and prosperity. ¹⁹ My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold, ¹⁹ my yield than choice silver. ²⁰ I walk in the way of righteousness, ²⁰ in the middle of the paths of justice, ²¹ that I may give wealth to those who love me. ²¹ I fill their treasuries. ²² “Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, ²² before his deeds of old. ²³ I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, ²³ before the earth existed. ²⁴ When there were no depths, I was born, ²⁴ when there were no springs abounding with water. ²⁵ Before the mountains were settled in place, ²⁵ before the hills, I was born; ²⁶ while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, ²⁶ nor the beginning of the dust of the world. ²⁷ When he established the heavens, I was there. ²⁷ When he set a circle on the surface of the deep, ²⁸ when he established the clouds above, ²⁸ when the springs of the deep became strong, ²⁹ when he gave to the sea its boundary, ²⁹ that the waters should not violate his commandment, ²⁹ when he marked out the foundations of the earth, ³⁰ then I was the craftsman by his side. ³⁰ I was a delight day by day, ³⁰ always rejoicing before him, ³¹ rejoicing in his whole world. ³¹ My delight was with the sons of men. ³² “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, ³² for blessed are those who keep my ways. ³³ Hear instruction, and be wise. ³³ Don’t refuse it. ³⁴ Blessed is the man who hears me, ³⁴ watching daily at my gates, ³⁴ waiting at my door posts. ³⁵ For whoever finds me, finds life, ³⁵ and will obtain favor from Yahweh. ³⁶ But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. ³⁶ All those who hate me love death.” # Proverbs 9

#### ¹ Wisdom has built her house. 
#### ¹ She has carved out her seven pillars. ² She has prepared her meat. ² She has mixed her wine. ² She has also set her table. ³ She has sent out her maidens. ³ She cries from the highest places of the city: ⁴ “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” ⁴ As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, ⁵ “Come, eat some of my bread, ⁵ Drink some of the wine which I have mixed! ⁶ Leave your simple ways, and live. ⁶ Walk in the way of understanding.” ⁷ One who corrects a mocker invites insult. ⁷ One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse. ⁸ Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. ⁸ Reprove a wise person, and he will love you. ⁹ Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser. ⁹ Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning. ¹⁰ The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. ¹⁰ The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. ¹¹ For by me your days will be multiplied. ¹¹ The years of your life will be increased. ¹² If you are wise, you are wise for yourself. ¹² If you mock, you alone will bear it. ¹³ The foolish woman is loud, ¹³ undisciplined, and knows nothing. ¹⁴ She sits at the door of her house, ¹⁴ on a seat in the high places of the city, ¹⁵ to call to those who pass by, ¹⁵ who go straight on their ways, ¹⁶ “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.” ¹⁶ as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, ¹⁷ “Stolen water is sweet. ¹⁷ Food eaten in secret is pleasant.” ¹⁸ But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there, ¹⁸ that her guests are in the depths of Sheol. # Proverbs 10

#### ¹ The proverbs of Solomon. 


#### ¹ A wise son makes a glad father; 
#### ¹ but a foolish son brings grief to his mother. ² Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, ² but righteousness delivers from death. ³ Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry, ³ but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked. ⁴ He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand, ⁴ but the hand of the diligent brings wealth. ⁵ He who gathers in summer is a wise son, ⁵ but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame. ⁶ Blessings are on the head of the righteous, ⁶ but violence covers the mouth of the wicked. ⁷ The memory of the righteous is blessed, ⁷ but the name of the wicked will rot. ⁸ The wise in heart accept commandments, ⁸ but a chattering fool will fall. ⁹ He who walks blamelessly walks surely, ⁹ but he who perverts his ways will be found out. ¹⁰ One winking with the eye causes sorrow, ¹⁰ but a chattering fool will fall. ¹¹ The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life, ¹¹ but violence covers the mouth of the wicked. ¹² Hatred stirs up strife, ¹² but love covers all wrongs. ¹³ Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment, ¹³ but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding. ¹⁴ Wise men lay up knowledge, ¹⁴ but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin. ¹⁵ The rich man’s wealth is his strong city. ¹⁵ The destruction of the poor is their poverty. ¹⁶ The labor of the righteous leads to life. ¹⁶ The increase of the wicked leads to sin. ¹⁷ He is in the way of life who heeds correction, ¹⁷ but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray. ¹⁸ He who hides hatred has lying lips. ¹⁸ He who utters a slander is a fool. ¹⁹ In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience, ¹⁹ but he who restrains his lips does wisely. ²⁰ The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver. ²⁰ The heart of the wicked is of little worth. ²¹ The lips of the righteous feed many, ²¹ but the foolish die for lack of understanding. ²² Yahweh’s blessing brings wealth, ²² and he adds no trouble to it. ²³ It is a fool’s pleasure to do wickedness, ²³ but wisdom is a man of understanding’s pleasure. ²⁴ What the wicked fear, will overtake them, ²⁴ but the desire of the righteous will be granted. ²⁵ When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more; ²⁵ but the righteous stand firm forever. ²⁶ As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, ²⁶ so is the sluggard to those who send him. ²⁷ The fear of Yahweh prolongs days, ²⁷ but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. ²⁸ The prospect of the righteous is joy, ²⁸ but the hope of the wicked will perish. ²⁹ The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright, ²⁹ but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. ³⁰ The righteous will never be removed, ³⁰ but the wicked will not dwell in the land. ³¹ The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom, ³¹ but the perverse tongue will be cut off. ³² The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, ³² but the mouth of the wicked is perverse. # Proverbs 11

#### ¹ A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh, 
#### ¹ but accurate weights are his delight. ² When pride comes, then comes shame, ² but with humility comes wisdom. ³ The integrity of the upright shall guide them, ³ but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. ⁴ Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath, ⁴ but righteousness delivers from death. ⁵ The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way, ⁵ but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. ⁶ The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, ⁶ but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires. ⁷ When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, ⁷ and expectation of power comes to nothing. ⁸ A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, ⁸ and the wicked takes his place. ⁹ With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, ⁹ but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge. ¹⁰ When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices. ¹⁰ When the wicked perish, there is shouting. ¹¹ By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, ¹¹ but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. ¹² One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, ¹² but a man of understanding holds his peace. ¹³ One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, ¹³ but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret. ¹⁴ Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, ¹⁴ but in the multitude of counselors there is victory. ¹⁵ He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it, ¹⁵ but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure. ¹⁶ A gracious woman obtains honor, ¹⁶ but violent men obtain riches. ¹⁷ The merciful man does good to his own soul, ¹⁷ but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh. ¹⁸ Wicked people earn deceitful wages, ¹⁸ but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward. ¹⁹ He who is truly righteous gets life. ¹⁹ He who pursues evil gets death. ²⁰ Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh, ²⁰ but those whose ways are blameless are his delight. ²¹ Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished, ²¹ but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered. ²² Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout, ²² is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. ²³ The desire of the righteous is only good. ²³ The expectation of the wicked is wrath. ²⁴ There is one who scatters, and increases yet more. ²⁴ There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty. ²⁵ The liberal soul shall be made fat. ²⁵ He who waters shall be watered also himself. ²⁶ People curse someone who withholds grain, ²⁶ but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it. ²⁷ He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, ²⁷ but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him. ²⁸ He who trusts in his riches will fall, ²⁸ but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. ²⁹ He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind. ²⁹ The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. ³⁰ The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. ³⁰ He who is wise wins souls. ³¹ Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth, ³¹ how much more the wicked and the sinner! # Proverbs 12

#### ¹ Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, 
#### ¹ but he who hates reproof is stupid. ² A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh, ² but he will condemn a man of wicked plans. ³ A man shall not be established by wickedness, ³ but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. ⁴ A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, ⁴ but a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his bones. ⁵ The thoughts of the righteous are just, ⁵ but the advice of the wicked is deceitful. ⁶ The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood, ⁶ but the speech of the upright rescues them. ⁷ The wicked are overthrown, and are no more, ⁷ but the house of the righteous shall stand. ⁸ A man shall be commended according to his wisdom, ⁸ but he who has a warped mind shall be despised. ⁹ Better is he who is little known, and has a servant, ⁹ than he who honors himself, and lacks bread. ¹⁰ A righteous man respects the life of his animal, ¹⁰ but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. ¹¹ He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, ¹¹ but he who chases fantasies is void of understanding. ¹² The wicked desires the plunder of evil men, ¹² but the root of the righteous flourishes. ¹³ An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips, ¹³ but the righteous shall come out of trouble. ¹⁴ A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth. ¹⁴ The work of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to him. ¹⁵ The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, ¹⁵ but he who is wise listens to counsel. ¹⁶ A fool shows his annoyance the same day, ¹⁶ but one who overlooks an insult is prudent. ¹⁷ He who is truthful testifies honestly, ¹⁷ but a false witness lies. ¹⁸ There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword, ¹⁸ but the tongue of the wise heals. ¹⁹ Truth’s lips will be established forever, ¹⁹ but a lying tongue is only momentary. ²⁰ Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, ²⁰ but joy comes to the promoters of peace. ²¹ No mischief shall happen to the righteous, ²¹ but the wicked shall be filled with evil. ²² Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh, ²² but those who do the truth are his delight. ²³ A prudent man keeps his knowledge, ²³ but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness. ²⁴ The hands of the diligent ones shall rule, ²⁴ but laziness ends in slave labor. ²⁵ Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, ²⁵ but a kind word makes it glad. ²⁶ A righteous person is cautious in friendship, ²⁶ but the way of the wicked leads them astray. ²⁷ The slothful man doesn’t roast his game, ²⁷ but the possessions of diligent men are prized. ²⁸ In the way of righteousness is life; ²⁸ in its path there is no death. # Proverbs 13

#### ¹ A wise son listens to his father’s instruction, 
#### ¹ but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke. ² By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things, ² but the unfaithful crave violence. ³ He who guards his mouth guards his soul. ³ One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. ⁴ The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing, ⁴ but the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied. ⁵ A righteous man hates lies, ⁵ but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace. ⁶ Righteousness guards the way of integrity, ⁶ but wickedness overthrows the sinner. ⁷ There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing. ⁷ There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth. ⁸ The ransom of a man’s life is his riches, ⁸ but the poor hear no threats. ⁹ The light of the righteous shines brightly, ⁹ but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out. ¹⁰ Pride only breeds quarrels, ¹⁰ but wisdom is with people who take advice. ¹¹ Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away, ¹¹ but he who gathers by hand makes it grow. ¹² Hope deferred makes the heart sick, ¹² but when longing is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. ¹³ Whoever despises instruction will pay for it, ¹³ but he who respects a command will be rewarded. ¹⁴ The teaching of the wise is a spring of life, ¹⁴ to turn from the snares of death. ¹⁵ Good understanding wins favor, ¹⁵ but the way of the unfaithful is hard. ¹⁶ Every prudent man acts from knowledge, ¹⁶ but a fool exposes folly. ¹⁷ A wicked messenger falls into trouble, ¹⁷ but a trustworthy envoy gains healing. ¹⁸ Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline, ¹⁸ but he who heeds correction shall be honored. ¹⁹ Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, ¹⁹ but fools detest turning from evil. ²⁰ One who walks with wise men grows wise, ²⁰ but a companion of fools suffers harm. ²¹ Misfortune pursues sinners, ²¹ but prosperity rewards the righteous. ²² A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, ²² but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous. ²³ An abundance of food is in poor people’s fields, ²³ but injustice sweeps it away. ²⁴ One who spares the rod hates his son, ²⁴ but one who loves him is careful to discipline him. ²⁵ The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul, ²⁵ but the belly of the wicked goes hungry. # Proverbs 14

#### ¹ Every wise woman builds her house, 
#### ¹ but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands. ² He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh, ² but he who is perverse in his ways despises him. ³ The fool’s talk brings a rod to his back, ³ but the lips of the wise protect them. ⁴ Where no oxen are, the crib is clean, ⁴ but much increase is by the strength of the ox. ⁵ A truthful witness will not lie, ⁵ but a false witness pours out lies. ⁶ A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it, ⁶ but knowledge comes easily to a discerning person. ⁷ Stay away from a foolish man, ⁷ for you won’t find knowledge on his lips. ⁸ The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way, ⁸ but the folly of fools is deceit. ⁹ Fools mock at making atonement for sins, ⁹ but among the upright there is good will. ¹⁰ The heart knows its own bitterness and joy; ¹⁰ he will not share these with a stranger. ¹¹ The house of the wicked will be overthrown, ¹¹ but the tent of the upright will flourish. ¹² There is a way which seems right to a man, ¹² but in the end it leads to death. ¹³ Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful, ¹³ and mirth may end in heaviness. ¹⁴ The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways; ¹⁴ likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways. ¹⁵ A simple man believes everything, ¹⁵ but the prudent man carefully considers his ways. ¹⁶ A wise man fears and shuns evil, ¹⁶ but the fool is hot headed and reckless. ¹⁷ He who is quick to become angry will commit folly, ¹⁷ and a crafty man is hated. ¹⁸ The simple inherit folly, ¹⁸ but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. ¹⁹ The evil bow down before the good, ¹⁹ and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. ²⁰ The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor, ²⁰ but the rich person has many friends. ²¹ He who despises his neighbor sins, ²¹ but he who has pity on the poor is blessed. ²² Don’t they go astray who plot evil? ²² But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good. ²³ In all hard work there is profit, ²³ but the talk of the lips leads only to poverty. ²⁴ The crown of the wise is their riches, ²⁴ but the folly of fools crowns them with folly. ²⁵ A truthful witness saves souls, ²⁵ but a false witness is deceitful. ²⁶ In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress, ²⁶ and he will be a refuge for his children. ²⁷ The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, ²⁷ turning people from the snares of death. ²⁸ In the multitude of people is the king’s glory, ²⁸ but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince. ²⁹ He who is slow to anger has great understanding, ²⁹ but he who has a quick temper displays folly. ³⁰ The life of the body is a heart at peace, ³⁰ but envy rots the bones. ³¹ He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker, ³¹ but he who is kind to the needy honors him. ³² The wicked is brought down in his calamity, ³² but in death, the righteous has a refuge. ³³ Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding, ³³ and is even made known in the inward part of fools. ³⁴ Righteousness exalts a nation, ³⁴ but sin is a disgrace to any people. ³⁵ The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely, ³⁵ but his wrath is toward one who causes shame. # Proverbs 15

#### ¹ A gentle answer turns away wrath, 
#### ¹ but a harsh word stirs up anger. ² The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, ² but the mouth of fools gush out folly. ³ Yahweh’s eyes are everywhere, ³ keeping watch on the evil and the good. ⁴ A gentle tongue is a tree of life, ⁴ but deceit in it crushes the spirit. ⁵ A fool despises his father’s correction, ⁵ but he who heeds reproof shows prudence. ⁶ In the house of the righteous is much treasure, ⁶ but the income of the wicked brings trouble. ⁷ The lips of the wise spread knowledge; ⁷ not so with the heart of fools. ⁸ The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, ⁸ but the prayer of the upright is his delight. ⁹ The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, ⁹ but he loves him who follows after righteousness. ¹⁰ There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way: ¹⁰ whoever hates reproof shall die. ¹¹ Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh— ¹¹ how much more then the hearts of the children of men! ¹² A scoffer doesn’t love to be reproved; ¹² he will not go to the wise. ¹³ A glad heart makes a cheerful face, ¹³ but an aching heart breaks the spirit. ¹⁴ The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge, ¹⁴ but the mouths of fools feed on folly. ¹⁵ All the days of the afflicted are wretched, ¹⁵ but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast. ¹⁶ Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, ¹⁶ than great treasure with trouble. ¹⁷ Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, ¹⁷ than a fattened calf with hatred. ¹⁸ A wrathful man stirs up contention, ¹⁸ but one who is slow to anger appeases strife. ¹⁹ The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, ¹⁹ but the path of the upright is a highway. ²⁰ A wise son makes a father glad, ²⁰ but a foolish man despises his mother. ²¹ Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom, ²¹ but a man of understanding keeps his way straight. ²² Where there is no counsel, plans fail; ²² but in a multitude of counselors they are established. ²³ Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth. ²³ How good is a word at the right time! ²⁴ The path of life leads upward for the wise, ²⁴ to keep him from going downward to Sheol. ²⁵ Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud, ²⁵ but he will keep the widow’s borders intact. ²⁶ Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked, ²⁶ but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing. ²⁷ He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, ²⁷ but he who hates bribes will live. ²⁸ The heart of the righteous weighs answers, ²⁸ but the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil. ²⁹ Yahweh is far from the wicked, ²⁹ but he hears the prayer of the righteous. ³⁰ The light of the eyes rejoices the heart. ³⁰ Good news gives health to the bones. ³¹ The ear that listens to reproof lives, ³¹ and will be at home among the wise. ³² He who refuses correction despises his own soul, ³² but he who listens to reproof gets understanding. ³³ The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom. ³³ Before honor is humility. # Proverbs 16

#### ¹ The plans of the heart belong to man, 
#### ¹ but the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh. ² All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; ² but Yahweh weighs the motives. ³ Commit your deeds to Yahweh, ³ and your plans shall succeed. ⁴ Yahweh has made everything for its own end— ⁴ yes, even the wicked for the day of evil. ⁵ Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh: ⁵ they shall certainly not be unpunished. ⁶ By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for. ⁶ By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil. ⁷ When a man’s ways please Yahweh, ⁷ he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. ⁸ Better is a little with righteousness, ⁸ than great revenues with injustice. ⁹ A man’s heart plans his course, ⁹ but Yahweh directs his steps. ¹⁰ Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king. ¹⁰ He shall not betray his mouth. ¹¹ Honest balances and scales are Yahweh’s; ¹¹ all the weights in the bag are his work. ¹² It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, ¹² for the throne is established by righteousness. ¹³ Righteous lips are the delight of kings. ¹³ They value one who speaks the truth. ¹⁴ The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, ¹⁴ but a wise man will pacify it. ¹⁵ In the light of the king’s face is life. ¹⁵ His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain. ¹⁶ How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! ¹⁶ Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. ¹⁷ The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. ¹⁷ He who keeps his way preserves his soul. ¹⁸ Pride goes before destruction, ¹⁸ and an arrogant spirit before a fall. ¹⁹ It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, ¹⁹ than to divide the plunder with the proud. ²⁰ He who heeds the Word finds prosperity. ²⁰ Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed. ²¹ The wise in heart shall be called prudent. ²¹ Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction. ²² Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it, ²² but the punishment of fools is their folly. ²³ The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, ²³ and adds learning to his lips. ²⁴ Pleasant words are a honeycomb, ²⁴ sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. ²⁵ There is a way which seems right to a man, ²⁵ but in the end it leads to death. ²⁶ The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; ²⁶ for his mouth urges him on. ²⁷ A worthless man devises mischief. ²⁷ His speech is like a scorching fire. ²⁸ A perverse man stirs up strife. ²⁸ A whisperer separates close friends. ²⁹ A man of violence entices his neighbor, ²⁹ and leads him in a way that is not good. ³⁰ One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, ³⁰ one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil. ³¹ Gray hair is a crown of glory. ³¹ It is attained by a life of righteousness. ³² One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; ³² one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city. ³³ The lot is cast into the lap, ³³ but its every decision is from Yahweh. # Proverbs 17

#### ¹ Better is a dry morsel with quietness, 
#### ¹ than a house full of feasting with strife. ² A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, ² and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers. ³ The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, ³ but Yahweh tests the hearts. ⁴ An evildoer heeds wicked lips. ⁴ A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue. ⁵ Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker. ⁵ He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. ⁶ Children’s children are the crown of old men; ⁶ the glory of children are their parents. ⁷ Arrogant speech isn’t fitting for a fool, ⁷ much less do lying lips fit a prince. ⁸ A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it; ⁸ wherever he turns, he prospers. ⁹ He who covers an offense promotes love; ⁹ but he who repeats a matter separates best friends. ¹⁰ A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding ¹⁰ than a hundred lashes into a fool. ¹¹ An evil man seeks only rebellion; ¹¹ therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. ¹² Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, ¹² rather than a fool in his folly. ¹³ Whoever rewards evil for good, ¹³ evil shall not depart from his house. ¹⁴ The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, ¹⁴ therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out. ¹⁵ He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, ¹⁵ both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh. ¹⁶ Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, ¹⁶ since he has no understanding? ¹⁷ A friend loves at all times; ¹⁷ and a brother is born for adversity. ¹⁸ A man void of understanding strikes hands, ¹⁸ and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor. ¹⁹ He who loves disobedience loves strife. ¹⁹ One who builds a high gate seeks destruction. ²⁰ One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity, ²⁰ and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble. ²¹ He who becomes the father of a fool grieves. ²¹ The father of a fool has no joy. ²² A cheerful heart makes good medicine, ²² but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. ²³ A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, ²³ to pervert the ways of justice. ²⁴ Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding, ²⁴ but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth. ²⁵ A foolish son brings grief to his father, ²⁵ and bitterness to her who bore him. ²⁶ Also to punish the righteous is not good, ²⁶ nor to flog officials for their integrity. ²⁷ He who spares his words has knowledge. ²⁷ He who is even tempered is a man of understanding. ²⁸ Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise. ²⁸ When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning. # Proverbs 18

#### ¹ A man who isolates himself pursues selfishness, 
#### ¹ and defies all sound judgment. ² A fool has no delight in understanding, ² but only in revealing his own opinion. ³ When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, ³ and with shame comes disgrace. ⁴ The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters. ⁴ The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook. ⁵ To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good, ⁵ nor to deprive the innocent of justice. ⁶ A fool’s lips come into strife, ⁶ and his mouth invites beatings. ⁷ A fool’s mouth is his destruction, ⁷ and his lips are a snare to his soul. ⁸ The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels: ⁸ they go down into a person’s innermost parts. ⁹ One who is slack in his work ⁹ is brother to him who is a master of destruction. ¹⁰ Yahweh’s name is a strong tower: ¹⁰ the righteous run to him, and are safe. ¹¹ The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, ¹¹ like an unscalable wall in his own imagination. ¹² Before destruction the heart of man is proud, ¹² but before honor is humility. ¹³ He who answers before he hears, ¹³ that is folly and shame to him. ¹⁴ A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness, ¹⁴ but a crushed spirit, who can bear? ¹⁵ The heart of the discerning gets knowledge. ¹⁵ The ear of the wise seeks knowledge. ¹⁶ A man’s gift makes room for him, ¹⁶ and brings him before great men. ¹⁷ He who pleads his cause first seems right; ¹⁷ until another comes and questions him. ¹⁸ The lot settles disputes, ¹⁸ and keeps strong ones apart. ¹⁹ A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city. ¹⁹ Disputes are like the bars of a fortress. ²⁰ A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth. ²⁰ With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied. ²¹ Death and life are in the power of the tongue; ²¹ those who love it will eat its fruit. ²² Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, ²² and obtains favor of Yahweh. ²³ The poor plead for mercy, ²³ but the rich answer harshly. ²⁴ A man of many companions may be ruined, ²⁴ but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. # Proverbs 19

#### ¹ Better is the poor who walks in his integrity 
#### ¹ than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool. ² It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge, ² nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way. ³ The foolishness of man subverts his way; ³ his heart rages against Yahweh. ⁴ Wealth adds many friends, ⁴ but the poor is separated from his friend. ⁵ A false witness shall not be unpunished. ⁵ He who pours out lies shall not go free. ⁶ Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, ⁶ and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. ⁷ All the relatives of the poor shun him: ⁷ how much more do his friends avoid him! ⁷ He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone. ⁸ He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. ⁸ He who keeps understanding shall find good. ⁹ A false witness shall not be unpunished. ⁹ He who utters lies shall perish. ¹⁰ Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, ¹⁰ much less for a servant to have rule over princes. ¹¹ The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. ¹¹ It is his glory to overlook an offense. ¹² The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, ¹² but his favor is like dew on the grass. ¹³ A foolish son is the calamity of his father. ¹³ A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping. ¹⁴ House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, ¹⁴ but a prudent wife is from Yahweh. ¹⁵ Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. ¹⁵ The idle soul shall suffer hunger. ¹⁶ He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, ¹⁶ but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die. ¹⁷ He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; ¹⁷ he will reward him. ¹⁸ Discipline your son, for there is hope; ¹⁸ don’t be a willing party to his death. ¹⁹ A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, ¹⁹ for if you rescue him, you must do it again. ²⁰ Listen to counsel and receive instruction, ²⁰ that you may be wise in your latter end. ²¹ There are many plans in a man’s heart, ²¹ but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail. ²² That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. ²² A poor man is better than a liar. ²³ The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; ²³ he rests and will not be touched by trouble. ²⁴ The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; ²⁴ he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. ²⁵ Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; ²⁵ rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge. ²⁶ He who robs his father and drives away his mother, ²⁶ is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. ²⁷ If you stop listening to instruction, my son, ²⁷ you will stray from the words of knowledge. ²⁸ A corrupt witness mocks justice, ²⁸ and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity. ²⁹ Penalties are prepared for scoffers, ²⁹ and beatings for the backs of fools. # Proverbs 20

#### ¹ Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler. 
#### ¹ Whoever is led astray by them is not wise. ² The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion. ² He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. ³ It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, ³ but every fool will be quarreling. ⁴ The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; ⁴ therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. ⁵ Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, ⁵ but a man of understanding will draw it out. ⁶ Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, ⁶ but who can find a faithful man? ⁷ A righteous man walks in integrity. ⁷ Blessed are his children after him. ⁸ A king who sits on the throne of judgment ⁸ scatters away all evil with his eyes. ⁹ Who can say, “I have made my heart pure. ⁹ I am clean and without sin?” ¹⁰ Differing weights and differing measures, ¹⁰ both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh. ¹¹ Even a child makes himself known by his doings, ¹¹ whether his work is pure, and whether it is right. ¹² The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, ¹² Yahweh has made even both of them. ¹³ Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty. ¹³ Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread. ¹⁴ “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer; ¹⁴ but when he is gone his way, then he boasts. ¹⁵ There is gold and abundance of rubies, ¹⁵ but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel. ¹⁶ Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger; ¹⁶ and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman. ¹⁷ Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, ¹⁷ but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel. ¹⁸ Plans are established by advice; ¹⁸ by wise guidance you wage war! ¹⁹ He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets; ¹⁹ therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips. ²⁰ Whoever curses his father or his mother, ²⁰ his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. ²¹ An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning, ²¹ won’t be blessed in the end. ²² Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.” ²² Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you. ²³ Yahweh detests differing weights, ²³ and dishonest scales are not pleasing. ²⁴ A man’s steps are from Yahweh; ²⁴ how then can man understand his way? ²⁵ It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, ²⁵ then later to consider his vows. ²⁶ A wise king winnows out the wicked, ²⁶ and drives the threshing wheel over them. ²⁷ The spirit of man is Yahweh’s lamp, ²⁷ searching all his innermost parts. ²⁸ Love and faithfulness keep the king safe. ²⁸ His throne is sustained by love. ²⁹ The glory of young men is their strength. ²⁹ The splendor of old men is their gray hair. ³⁰ Wounding blows cleanse away evil, ³⁰ and beatings purge the innermost parts. # Proverbs 21

#### ¹ The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses. 
#### ¹ He turns it wherever he desires. ² Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, ² but Yahweh weighs the hearts. ³ To do righteousness and justice ³ is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice. ⁴ A high look and a proud heart, ⁴ the lamp of the wicked, is sin. ⁵ The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; ⁵ and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty. ⁶ Getting treasures by a lying tongue ⁶ is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death. ⁷ The violence of the wicked will drive them away, ⁷ because they refuse to do what is right. ⁸ The way of the guilty is devious, ⁸ but the conduct of the innocent is upright. ⁹ It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop ⁹ than to share a house with a contentious woman. ¹⁰ The soul of the wicked desires evil; ¹⁰ his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes. ¹¹ When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. ¹¹ When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. ¹² The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, ¹² and brings the wicked to ruin. ¹³ Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, ¹³ he will also cry out, but shall not be heard. ¹⁴ A gift in secret pacifies anger, ¹⁴ and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath. ¹⁵ It is joy to the righteous to do justice; ¹⁵ but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. ¹⁶ The man who wanders out of the way of understanding ¹⁶ shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits. ¹⁷ He who loves pleasure will be a poor man. ¹⁷ He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich. ¹⁸ The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, ¹⁸ the treacherous for the upright. ¹⁹ It is better to dwell in a desert land, ¹⁹ than with a contentious and fretful woman. ²⁰ There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; ²⁰ but a foolish man swallows it up. ²¹ He who follows after righteousness and kindness ²¹ finds life, righteousness, and honor. ²² A wise man scales the city of the mighty, ²² and brings down the strength of its confidence. ²³ Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue ²³ keeps his soul from troubles. ²⁴ The proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name— ²⁴ he works in the arrogance of pride. ²⁵ The desire of the sluggard kills him, ²⁵ for his hands refuse to labor. ²⁶ There are those who covet greedily all day long; ²⁶ but the righteous give and don’t withhold. ²⁷ The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination— ²⁷ how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind! ²⁸ A false witness will perish. ²⁸ A man who listens speaks to eternity. ²⁹ A wicked man hardens his face; ²⁹ but as for the upright, he establishes his ways. ³⁰ There is no wisdom nor understanding ³⁰ nor counsel against Yahweh. ³¹ The horse is prepared for the day of battle; ³¹ but victory is with Yahweh. # Proverbs 22

#### ¹ A good name is more desirable than great riches, 
#### ¹ and loving favor is better than silver and gold. ² The rich and the poor have this in common: ² Yahweh is the maker of them all. ³ A prudent man sees danger and hides himself; ³ but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. ⁴ The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh ⁴ is wealth, honor, and life. ⁵ Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked: ⁵ whoever guards his soul stays from them. ⁶ Train up a child in the way he should go, ⁶ and when he is old he will not depart from it. ⁷ The rich rule over the poor. ⁷ The borrower is servant to the lender. ⁸ He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, ⁸ and the rod of his fury will be destroyed. ⁹ He who has a generous eye will be blessed; ⁹ for he shares his food with the poor. ¹⁰ Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; ¹⁰ yes, quarrels and insults will stop. ¹¹ He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully ¹¹ is the king’s friend. ¹² Yahweh’s eyes watch over knowledge; ¹² but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful. ¹³ The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside! ¹³ I will be killed in the streets!” ¹⁴ The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit. ¹⁴ He who is under Yahweh’s wrath will fall into it. ¹⁵ Folly is bound up in the heart of a child: ¹⁵ the rod of discipline drives it far from him. ¹⁶ Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, ¹⁶ both come to poverty. ¹⁷ Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise. ¹⁷ Apply your heart to my teaching. ¹⁸ For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, ¹⁸ if all of them are ready on your lips. ¹⁹ I teach you today, even you, ¹⁹ So that your trust may be in Yahweh. ²⁰ Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things ²⁰ of counsel and knowledge, ²¹ To teach you truth, reliable words, ²¹ to give sound answers to the ones who sent you? ²² Don’t exploit the poor, because he is poor; ²² and don’t crush the needy in court; ²³ for Yahweh will plead their case, ²³ and plunder the life of those who plunder them. ²⁴ Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man, ²⁴ and don’t associate with one who harbors anger: ²⁵ lest you learn his ways, ²⁵ and ensnare your soul. ²⁶ Don’t you be one of those who strike hands, ²⁶ of those who are collateral for debts. ²⁷ If you don’t have means to pay, ²⁷ why should he take away your bed from under you? ²⁸ Don’t move the ancient boundary stone ²⁸ which your fathers have set up. ²⁹ Do you see a man skilled in his work? ²⁹ He will serve kings. ²⁹ He won’t serve obscure men. # Proverbs 23

#### ¹ consider diligently what is before you; ² put a knife to your throat, ² if you are a man given to appetite. ³ Don’t be desirous of his dainties, ³ since they are deceitful food. ⁴ Don’t weary yourself to be rich. ⁴ In your wisdom, show restraint. ⁵ Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? ⁵ For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky. ⁶ Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, ⁶ and don’t crave his delicacies: ⁷ for as he thinks about the cost, so he is. ⁷ “Eat and drink!” he says to you, ⁷ but his heart is not with you. ⁸ The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, ⁸ and lose your good words. ⁹ Don’t speak in the ears of a fool, ⁹ for he will despise the wisdom of your words. ¹⁰ Don’t move the ancient boundary stone. ¹⁰ Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless, ¹¹ for their Defender is strong. ¹¹ He will plead their case against you. ¹² Apply your heart to instruction, ¹² and your ears to the words of knowledge. ¹³ Don’t withhold correction from a child. ¹³ If you punish him with the rod, he will not die. ¹⁴ Punish him with the rod, ¹⁴ and save his soul from Sheol. ¹⁵ My son, if your heart is wise, ¹⁵ then my heart will be glad, even mine. ¹⁶ Yes, my heart will rejoice ¹⁶ when your lips speak what is right. ¹⁷ Don’t let your heart envy sinners, ¹⁷ but rather fear Yahweh all day long. ¹⁸ Indeed surely there is a future hope, ¹⁸ and your hope will not be cut off. ¹⁹ Listen, my son, and be wise, ¹⁹ and keep your heart on the right path! ²⁰ Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine, ²⁰ or those who gorge themselves on meat: ²¹ for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; ²¹ and drowsiness clothes them in rags. ²² Listen to your father who gave you life, ²² and don’t despise your mother when she is old. ²³ Buy the truth, and don’t sell it. ²³ Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding. ²⁴ The father of the righteous has great joy. ²⁴ Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him. ²⁵ Let your father and your mother be glad! ²⁵ Let her who bore you rejoice! ²⁶ My son, give me your heart; ²⁶ and let your eyes keep in my ways. ²⁷ For a prostitute is a deep pit; ²⁷ and a wayward wife is a narrow well. ²⁸ Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, ²⁸ and increases the unfaithful among men. ²⁹ Who has woe? ²⁹ Who has sorrow? ²⁹ Who has strife? ²⁹ Who has complaints? ²⁹ Who has needless bruises? ²⁹ Who has bloodshot eyes? ³⁰ Those who stay long at the wine; ³⁰ those who go to seek out mixed wine. ³¹ Don’t look at the wine when it is red, ³¹ when it sparkles in the cup, ³¹ when it goes down smoothly. ³² In the end, it bites like a snake, ³² and poisons like a viper. ³³ Your eyes will see strange things, ³³ and your mind will imagine confusing things. ³⁴ Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea, ³⁴ or as he who lies on top of the rigging: ³⁵ “They hit me, and I was not hurt! ³⁵ They beat me, and I don’t feel it! ³⁵ When will I wake up? I can do it again. ³⁵ I can find another.” # Proverbs 24

#### ¹ Don’t be envious of evil men, 
#### ¹ neither desire to be with them; ² for their hearts plot violence ² and their lips talk about mischief. ³ Through wisdom a house is built; ³ by understanding it is established; ⁴ by knowledge the rooms are filled ⁴ with all rare and beautiful treasure. ⁵ A wise man has great power; ⁵ and a knowledgeable man increases strength; ⁶ for by wise guidance you wage your war; ⁶ and victory is in many advisors. ⁷ Wisdom is too high for a fool. ⁷ He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate. ⁸ One who plots to do evil ⁸ will be called a schemer. ⁹ The schemes of folly are sin. ⁹ The mocker is detested by men. ¹⁰ If you falter in the time of trouble, ¹⁰ your strength is small. ¹¹ Rescue those who are being led away to death! ¹¹ Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter! ¹² If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,” ¹² doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it? ¹² He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it? ¹² Shall he not render to every man according to his work? ¹³ My son, eat honey, for it is good, ¹³ the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste; ¹⁴ so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul. ¹⁴ If you have found it, then there will be a reward: ¹⁴ Your hope will not be cut off. ¹⁵ Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. ¹⁵ Don’t destroy his resting place; ¹⁶ for a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again; ¹⁶ but the wicked are overthrown by calamity. ¹⁷ Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls. ¹⁷ Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown, ¹⁸ lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, ¹⁸ and he turn away his wrath from him. ¹⁹ Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers, ¹⁹ neither be envious of the wicked; ²⁰ for there will be no reward to the evil man. ²⁰ The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. ²¹ My son, fear Yahweh and the king. ²¹ Don’t join those who are rebellious; ²² for their calamity will rise suddenly. ²² Who knows what destruction may come from them both? 
#### ²³ These also are sayings of the wise. 

²³ To show partiality in judgment is not good. ²⁴ He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,” ²⁴ peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him— ²⁵ but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, ²⁵ and a rich blessing will come on them. ²⁶ An honest answer ²⁶ is like a kiss on the lips. ²⁷ Prepare your work outside, ²⁷ and get your fields ready. ²⁷ Afterwards, build your house. ²⁸ Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause. ²⁸ Don’t deceive with your lips. ²⁹ Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; ²⁹ I will repay the man according to his work.” ³⁰ I went by the field of the sluggard, ³⁰ by the vineyard of the man void of understanding: ³¹ Behold, it was all grown over with thorns. ³¹ Its surface was covered with nettles, ³¹ and its stone wall was broken down. ³² Then I saw, and considered well. ³² I saw, and received instruction: ³³ a little sleep, a little slumber, ³³ a little folding of the hands to sleep, ³⁴ so your poverty will come as a robber ³⁴ and your want as an armed man. # Proverbs 25

#### ¹ These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 


#### ² It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, ² but the glory of kings is to search out a matter. ³ As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, ³ so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. ⁴ Take away the dross from the silver, ⁴ and material comes out for the refiner; ⁵ Take away the wicked from the king’s presence, ⁵ and his throne will be established in righteousness. ⁶ Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king, ⁶ or claim a place among great men; ⁷ for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,” ⁷ than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, ⁷ whom your eyes have seen. ⁸ Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court. ⁸ What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you? ⁹ Debate your case with your neighbor, ⁹ and don’t betray the confidence of another, ¹⁰ lest one who hears it put you to shame, ¹⁰ and your bad reputation never depart. ¹¹ A word fitly spoken ¹¹ is like apples of gold in settings of silver. ¹² As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, ¹² so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear. ¹³ As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, ¹³ so is a faithful messenger to those who send him; ¹³ for he refreshes the soul of his masters. ¹⁴ As clouds and wind without rain, ¹⁴ so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively. ¹⁵ By patience a ruler is persuaded. ¹⁵ A soft tongue breaks the bone. ¹⁶ Have you found honey? ¹⁶ Eat as much as is sufficient for you, ¹⁶ lest you eat too much, and vomit it. ¹⁷ Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, ¹⁷ lest he be weary of you, and hate you. ¹⁸ A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor ¹⁸ is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow. ¹⁹ Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble ¹⁹ is like a bad tooth or a lame foot. ²⁰ As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, ²⁰ or vinegar on soda, ²⁰ so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. ²¹ If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat. ²¹ If he is thirsty, give him water to drink; ²² for you will heap coals of fire on his head, ²² and Yahweh will reward you. ²³ The north wind produces rain; ²³ so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face. ²⁴ It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop ²⁴ than to share a house with a contentious woman. ²⁵ Like cold water to a thirsty soul, ²⁵ so is good news from a far country. ²⁶ Like a muddied spring and a polluted well, ²⁶ so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked. ²⁷ It is not good to eat much honey, ²⁷ nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor. ²⁸ Like a city that is broken down and without walls ²⁸ is a man whose spirit is without restraint. # Proverbs 26

#### ¹ Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, 
#### ¹ so honor is not fitting for a fool. ² Like a fluttering sparrow, ² like a darting swallow, ² so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest. ³ A whip is for the horse, ³ a bridle for the donkey, ³ and a rod for the back of fools! ⁴ Don’t answer a fool according to his folly, ⁴ lest you also be like him. ⁵ Answer a fool according to his folly, ⁵ lest he be wise in his own eyes. ⁶ One who sends a message by the hand of a fool ⁶ is cutting off feet and drinking violence. ⁷ Like the legs of the lame that hang loose, ⁷ so is a parable in the mouth of fools. ⁸ As one who binds a stone in a sling, ⁸ so is he who gives honor to a fool. ⁹ Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, ⁹ so is a parable in the mouth of fools. ¹⁰ As an archer who wounds all, ¹⁰ so is he who hires a fool ¹⁰ or he who hires those who pass by. ¹¹ As a dog that returns to his vomit, ¹¹ so is a fool who repeats his folly. ¹² Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? ¹² There is more hope for a fool than for him. ¹³ The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road! ¹³ A fierce lion roams the streets!” ¹⁴ As the door turns on its hinges, ¹⁴ so does the sluggard on his bed. ¹⁵ The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. ¹⁵ He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. ¹⁶ The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes ¹⁶ than seven men who answer with discretion. ¹⁷ Like one who grabs a dog’s ears ¹⁷ is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own. ¹⁸ Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death, ¹⁹ is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?” ²⁰ For lack of wood a fire goes out. ²⁰ Without gossip, a quarrel dies down. ²¹ As coals are to hot embers, ²¹ and wood to fire, ²¹ so is a contentious man to kindling strife. ²² The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, ²² they go down into the innermost parts. ²³ Like silver dross on an earthen vessel ²³ are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart. ²⁴ A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, ²⁴ but he harbors evil in his heart. ²⁵ When his speech is charming, don’t believe him, ²⁵ for there are seven abominations in his heart. ²⁶ His malice may be concealed by deception, ²⁶ but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. ²⁷ Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. ²⁷ Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him. ²⁸ A lying tongue hates those it hurts; ²⁸ and a flattering mouth works ruin. # Proverbs 27

#### ¹ Don’t boast about tomorrow; 
#### ¹ for you don’t know what a day may bring. ² Let another man praise you, ² and not your own mouth; ² a stranger, and not your own lips. ³ A stone is heavy, ³ and sand is a burden; ³ but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both. ⁴ Wrath is cruel, ⁴ and anger is overwhelming; ⁴ but who is able to stand before jealousy? ⁵ Better is open rebuke ⁵ than hidden love. ⁶ The wounds of a friend are faithful, ⁶ although the kisses of an enemy are profuse. ⁷ A full soul loathes a honeycomb; ⁷ but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet. ⁸ As a bird that wanders from her nest, ⁸ so is a man who wanders from his home. ⁹ Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; ⁹ so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend. ¹⁰ Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend. ¹⁰ Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster. ¹⁰ A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother. ¹¹ Be wise, my son, ¹¹ and bring joy to my heart, ¹¹ then I can answer my tormentor. ¹² A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; ¹² but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. ¹³ Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. ¹³ Hold it for a wayward woman! ¹⁴ He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, ¹⁴ it will be taken as a curse by him. ¹⁵ A continual dropping on a rainy day ¹⁵ and a contentious wife are alike: ¹⁶ restraining her is like restraining the wind, ¹⁶ or like grasping oil in his right hand. ¹⁷ Iron sharpens iron; ¹⁷ so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance. ¹⁸ Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. ¹⁸ He who looks after his master shall be honored. ¹⁹ Like water reflects a face, ¹⁹ so a man’s heart reflects the man. ²⁰ Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; ²⁰ and a man’s eyes are never satisfied. ²¹ The crucible is for silver, ²¹ and the furnace for gold; ²¹ but man is refined by his praise. ²² Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, ²² yet his foolishness will not be removed from him. ²³ Know well the state of your flocks, ²³ and pay attention to your herds: ²⁴ for riches are not forever, ²⁴ nor does the crown endure to all generations. ²⁵ The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, ²⁵ the grasses of the hills are gathered in. ²⁶ The lambs are for your clothing, ²⁶ and the goats are the price of a field. ²⁷ There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food, ²⁷ for your family’s food, ²⁷ and for the nourishment of your servant girls. # Proverbs 28

#### ¹ The wicked flee when no one pursues; 
#### ¹ but the righteous are as bold as a lion. ² In rebellion, a land has many rulers, ² but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge. ³ A needy man who oppresses the poor ³ is like a driving rain which leaves no crops. ⁴ Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; ⁴ but those who keep the law contend with them. ⁵ Evil men don’t understand justice; ⁵ but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully. ⁶ Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, ⁶ than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich. ⁷ Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; ⁷ but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father. ⁸ He who increases his wealth by excessive interest ⁸ gathers it for one who has pity on the poor. ⁹ He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, ⁹ even his prayer is an abomination. ¹⁰ Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, ¹⁰ he will fall into his own trap; ¹⁰ but the blameless will inherit good. ¹¹ The rich man is wise in his own eyes; ¹¹ but the poor who has understanding sees through him. ¹² When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; ¹² but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. ¹³ He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper, ¹³ but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. ¹⁴ Blessed is the man who always fears; ¹⁴ but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble. ¹⁵ As a roaring lion or a charging bear, ¹⁵ so is a wicked ruler over helpless people. ¹⁶ A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. ¹⁶ One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days. ¹⁷ A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death; ¹⁷ no one will support him. ¹⁸ Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; ¹⁸ but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly. ¹⁹ One who works his land will have an abundance of food; ¹⁹ but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. ²⁰ A faithful man is rich with blessings; ²⁰ but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished. ²¹ To show partiality is not good; ²¹ yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread. ²² A stingy man hurries after riches, ²² and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him. ²³ One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor ²³ than one who flatters with the tongue. ²⁴ Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,” ²⁴ is a partner with a destroyer. ²⁵ One who is greedy stirs up strife; ²⁵ but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper. ²⁶ One who trusts in himself is a fool; ²⁶ but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe. ²⁷ One who gives to the poor has no lack; ²⁷ but one who closes his eyes will have many curses. ²⁸ When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; ²⁸ but when they perish, the righteous thrive. # Proverbs 29

#### ¹ He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck 
#### ¹ will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy. ² When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; ² but when the wicked rule, the people groan. ³ Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father; ³ but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. ⁴ The king by justice makes the land stable, ⁴ but he who takes bribes tears it down. ⁵ A man who flatters his neighbor ⁵ spreads a net for his feet. ⁶ An evil man is snared by his sin, ⁶ but the righteous can sing and be glad. ⁷ The righteous care about justice for the poor. ⁷ The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge. ⁸ Mockers stir up a city, ⁸ but wise men turn away anger. ⁹ If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, ⁹ the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace. ¹⁰ The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; ¹⁰ and they seek the life of the upright. ¹¹ A fool vents all of his anger, ¹¹ but a wise man brings himself under control. ¹² If a ruler listens to lies, ¹² all of his officials are wicked. ¹³ The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: ¹³ Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both. ¹⁴ The king who fairly judges the poor, ¹⁴ his throne shall be established forever. ¹⁵ The rod of correction gives wisdom, ¹⁵ but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother. ¹⁶ When the wicked increase, sin increases; ¹⁶ but the righteous will see their downfall. ¹⁷ Correct your son, and he will give you peace; ¹⁷ yes, he will bring delight to your soul. ¹⁸ Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; ¹⁸ but one who keeps the law is blessed. ¹⁹ A servant can’t be corrected by words. ¹⁹ Though he understands, yet he will not respond. ²⁰ Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? ²⁰ There is more hope for a fool than for him. ²¹ He who pampers his servant from youth ²¹ will have him become a son in the end. ²² An angry man stirs up strife, ²² and a wrathful man abounds in sin. ²³ A man’s pride brings him low, ²³ but one of lowly spirit gains honor. ²⁴ Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul. ²⁴ He takes an oath, but dares not testify. ²⁵ The fear of man proves to be a snare, ²⁵ but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe. ²⁶ Many seek the ruler’s favor, ²⁶ but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh. ²⁷ A dishonest man detests the righteous, ²⁷ and the upright in their ways detest the wicked. # Proverbs 30

#### ¹ The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the revelation: 


#### ¹ the man says to Ithiel, 
#### ¹ to Ithiel and Ucal: ² “Surely I am the most ignorant man, ² and don’t have a man’s understanding. ³ I have not learned wisdom, ³ neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One. ⁴ Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? ⁴ Who has gathered the wind in his fists? ⁴ Who has bound the waters in his garment? ⁴ Who has established all the ends of the earth? ⁴ What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know? ⁵ “Every word of God is flawless. ⁵ He is a shield to those who take refuge in him. ⁶ Don’t you add to his words, ⁶ lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar. ⁷ “Two things I have asked of you. ⁷ Don’t deny me before I die. ⁸ Remove far from me falsehood and lies. ⁸ Give me neither poverty nor riches. ⁸ Feed me with the food that is needful for me, ⁹ lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is Yahweh?’ ⁹ or lest I be poor, and steal, ⁹ and so dishonor the name of my God. ¹⁰ “Don’t slander a servant to his master, ¹⁰ lest he curse you, and you be held guilty. ¹¹ There is a generation that curses their father, ¹¹ and doesn’t bless their mother. ¹² There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, ¹² yet are not washed from their filthiness. ¹³ There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! ¹³ Their eyelids are lifted up. ¹⁴ There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, ¹⁴ and their jaws like knives, ¹⁴ to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from among men. ¹⁵ “The leech has two daughters: ¹⁵ ‘Give, give.’ ¹⁵ “There are three things that are never satisfied; ¹⁵ four that don’t say, ‘Enough:’ ¹⁶ Sheol, ¹⁶ the barren womb; ¹⁶ the earth that is not satisfied with water; ¹⁶ and the fire that doesn’t say, ‘Enough.’ ¹⁷ “The eye that mocks at his father, ¹⁷ and scorns obedience to his mother: ¹⁷ the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, ¹⁷ the young eagles shall eat it. ¹⁸ “There are three things which are too amazing for me, ¹⁸ four which I don’t understand: ¹⁹ The way of an eagle in the air, ¹⁹ the way of a serpent on a rock, ¹⁹ the way of a ship in the middle of the sea, ¹⁹ and the way of a man with a maiden. ²⁰ “So is the way of an adulterous woman: ²⁰ She eats and wipes her mouth, ²⁰ and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’ ²¹ “For three things the earth trembles, ²¹ and under four, it can’t bear up: ²² For a servant when he is king, ²² a fool when he is filled with food, ²³ for an unloved woman when she is married, ²³ and a servant who is heir to her mistress. ²⁴ “There are four things which are little on the earth, ²⁴ but they are exceedingly wise: ²⁵ The ants are not a strong people, ²⁵ yet they provide their food in the summer. ²⁶ The hyraxes are but a feeble folk, ²⁶ yet make they their houses in the rocks. ²⁷ The locusts have no king, ²⁷ yet they advance in ranks. ²⁸ You can catch a lizard with your hands, ²⁸ yet it is in kings’ palaces. ²⁹ “There are three things which are stately in their march, ²⁹ four which are stately in going: ³⁰ The lion, which is mightiest among animals, ³⁰ and doesn’t turn away for any; ³¹ the greyhound; ³¹ the male goat; ³¹ and the king against whom there is no rising up. ³² “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, ³² or if you have thought evil, ³² put your hand over your mouth. ³³ For as the churning of milk produces butter, ³³ and the wringing of the nose produces blood; ³³ so the forcing of wrath produces strife.” # Proverbs 31

#### ¹ The words of king Lemuel; the revelation which his mother taught him. 


#### ² “Oh, my son! ² Oh, son of my womb! ² Oh, son of my vows! ³ Don’t give your strength to women, ³ nor your ways to that which destroys kings. ⁴ It is not for kings, Lemuel, ⁴ it is not for kings to drink wine, ⁴ nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’ ⁵ lest they drink, and forget the law, ⁵ and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted. ⁶ Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, ⁶ and wine to the bitter in soul. ⁷ Let him drink, and forget his poverty, ⁷ and remember his misery no more. ⁸ Open your mouth for the mute, ⁸ in the cause of all who are left desolate. ⁹ Open your mouth, judge righteously, ⁹ and serve justice to the poor and needy.” ¹⁰ Who can find a worthy woman? ¹⁰ For her price is far above rubies. ¹¹ The heart of her husband trusts in her. ¹¹ He shall have no lack of gain. ¹² She does him good, and not harm, ¹² all the days of her life. ¹³ She seeks wool and flax, ¹³ and works eagerly with her hands. ¹⁴ She is like the merchant ships. ¹⁴ She brings her bread from afar. ¹⁵ She rises also while it is yet night, ¹⁵ gives food to her household, ¹⁵ and portions for her servant girls. ¹⁶ She considers a field, and buys it. ¹⁶ With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard. ¹⁷ She arms her waist with strength, ¹⁷ and makes her arms strong. ¹⁸ She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. ¹⁸ Her lamp doesn’t go out by night. ¹⁹ She lays her hands to the distaff, ¹⁹ and her hands hold the spindle. ²⁰ She opens her arms to the poor; ²⁰ yes, she extends her hands to the needy. ²¹ She is not afraid of the snow for her household; ²¹ for all her household are clothed with scarlet. ²² She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. ²² Her clothing is fine linen and purple. ²³ Her husband is respected in the gates, ²³ when he sits among the elders of the land. ²⁴ She makes linen garments and sells them, ²⁴ and delivers sashes to the merchant. ²⁵ Strength and dignity are her clothing. ²⁵ She laughs at the time to come. ²⁶ She opens her mouth with wisdom. ²⁶ Kind instruction is on her tongue. ²⁷ She looks well to the ways of her household, ²⁷ and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness. ²⁸ Her children rise up and call her blessed. ²⁸ Her husband also praises her: ²⁹ “Many women do noble things, ²⁹ but you excel them all.” ³⁰ Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; ³⁰ but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised. ³¹ Give her of the fruit of her hands! ³¹ Let her works praise her in the gates!
