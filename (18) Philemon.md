# Philemon 1

#### ¹ Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, ² to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: ³ Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lᴏʀᴅ Jesus Christ. 


#### ⁴ I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, ⁵ hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lᴏʀᴅ Jesus, and toward all the saints, ⁶ that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. ⁷ For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. 


#### ⁸ Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate, ⁹ yet for love’s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. ¹⁰ I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus, ¹¹ who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me. ¹² I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, ¹³ whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. ¹⁴ But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will. ¹⁵ For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever, ¹⁶ no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lᴏʀᴅ. 


#### ¹⁷ If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me. ¹⁸ But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account. ¹⁹ I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides). ²⁰ Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lᴏʀᴅ. Refresh my heart in the Lᴏʀᴅ. 


#### ²¹ Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. 


#### ²² Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 


#### ²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, ²⁴ as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 


#### ²⁵ The grace of our Lᴏʀᴅ Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
