# Ezekiel 1

#### ¹ Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 


#### ² In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, ³ Yahweh’s word came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and Yahweh’s hand was there on him. 


#### ⁴ I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it, and out of the middle of it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire. ⁵ Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man. ⁶ Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings. ⁷ Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. ⁸ They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had their faces and their wings like this: ⁹ Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went. Each one went straight forward. 


#### ¹⁰ As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion on the right side. The four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle. ¹¹ Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies. ¹² Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went. They didn’t turn when they went. ¹³ As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. The fire went up and down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire. ¹⁴ The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. 


#### ¹⁵ Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it. ¹⁶ The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four of them had one likeness. Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. ¹⁷ When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when they went. ¹⁸ As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around. 


#### ¹⁹ When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. ²⁰ Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there. The wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. ²¹ When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 


#### ²² Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like an awesome crystal to look at, stretched out over their heads above. ²³ Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their bodies on that side. ²⁴ When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings. 


#### ²⁵ There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings. ²⁶ Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above. ²⁷ I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. ²⁸ As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. 


#### ²⁸ This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke. 

# Ezekiel 2

#### ¹ He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.” ² The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me. 


#### ³ He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day. ⁴ The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says.’ ⁵ They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse, for they are a rebellious house, yet they will know that there has been a prophet among them. ⁶ You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. ⁷ You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious. ⁸ But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.” 


#### ⁹ When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was in it. ¹⁰ He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations, mourning, and woe were written in it. 

# Ezekiel 3

#### ¹ He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” 


#### ² So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll. 


#### ³ He said to me, “Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you.” 


#### ³ Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. 


#### ⁴ He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them. ⁵ For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel; ⁶ not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. ⁷ But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard-hearted. ⁸ Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads. ⁹ I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.” 


#### ¹⁰ Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you. ¹¹ Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says,’ whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse. 


#### ¹² Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, “Blessed be Yahweh’s glory from his place.” ¹³ I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing. ¹⁴ So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and Yahweh’s hand was strong on me. ¹⁵ Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days. 


#### ¹⁶ At the end of seven days, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹⁷ “Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me. ¹⁸ When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; that wicked man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand. ¹⁹ Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.” 


#### ²⁰ “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand. ²¹ Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.” 


#### ²² Yahweh’s hand was there on me; and he said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.” 


#### ²³ Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, Yahweh’s glory stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. Then I fell on my face. 


#### ²⁴ Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house. ²⁵ But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them. ²⁶ I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be able to correct them; for they are a rebellious house. ²⁷ But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.” 

# Ezekiel 4

#### ¹ “You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem. ² Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it and plant battering rams against it all around. ³ Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city. Then set your face toward it. It will be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. 


#### ⁴ “Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. According to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. ⁵ For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 


#### ⁶ “Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you. ⁷ You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it. ⁸ Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege. 


#### ⁹ “Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it. According to the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it. ¹⁰ Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day. From time to time you shall eat it. ¹¹ You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. From time to time you shall drink. ¹² You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.” ¹³ Yahweh said, “Even thus will the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.” 


#### ¹⁴ Then I said, “Ah Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals. No abominable meat has come into my mouth!” 


#### ¹⁵ Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.” 


#### ¹⁶ Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness. They will drink water by measure, and in dismay; ¹⁷ that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity. 

# Ezekiel 5

#### ¹ “You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor to yourself, and shall cause it to pass over your head and over your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair. ² A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. ³ You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in the folds of your robe. ⁴ Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a fire will come out into all the house of Israel. 


#### ⁵ “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her. ⁶ She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.’ 


#### ⁷ “Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that are around you; ⁸ therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations. ⁹ I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything like it any more, because of all your abominations. ¹⁰ Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you; and I will scatter the whole remnant of you to all the winds. ¹¹ Therefore as I live,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, ‘surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity. ¹² A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed with famine within you. A third part will fall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them. 


#### ¹³ “ ‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them. 


#### ¹⁴ “ ‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by. ¹⁵ So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, Yahweh, have spoken it— ¹⁶ when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread. ¹⁷ I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood will pass through you. I will bring the sword on you. I, Yahweh, have spoken it.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 6

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them, ³ and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh! The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places. ⁴ Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols. ⁵ I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars. ⁶ In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. ⁷ The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahweh. 


#### ⁸ “ ‘ “Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries. ⁹ Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. ¹⁰ They will know that I am Yahweh. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.” ’ 


#### ¹¹ “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!” Because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. ¹² He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them. ¹³ You will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols. ¹⁴ I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 7

#### ¹ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “You, son of man, the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land. ³ Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. ⁴ My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’ 


#### ⁵ “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘An evil! A unique evil! Behold, it comes. ⁶ An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes. ⁷ Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains. ⁸ Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. ⁹ My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways. Your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, strike. 


#### ¹⁰ “ ‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Pride has budded. ¹¹ Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There will be nothing of value among them. ¹² The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude. ¹³ For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision concerns the whole multitude of it. None will return. None will strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. ¹⁴ They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all its multitude. 


#### ¹⁵ “ ‘The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within. He who is in the field will die by the sword. He who is in the city will be devoured by famine and pestilence. ¹⁶ But those of those who escape, they will escape and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity. ¹⁷ All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water. ¹⁸ They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. ¹⁹ They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold won’t be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh’s wrath. They won’t satisfy their souls or fill their bellies; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity. ²⁰ As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein. Therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing. ²¹ I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they will profane it. ²² I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place. Robbers will enter into it, and profane it. 


#### ²³ “ ‘Make chains; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. ²⁴ Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong to cease. Their holy places will be profaned. ²⁵ Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none. ²⁶ Mischief will come on mischief, and rumor will be on rumor. They will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. ²⁷ The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The hands of the people of the land will be troubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments I will judge them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 8

#### ¹ In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh’s hand fell on me there. ² Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire; and from his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal. ³ He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north; where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. ⁴ Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain. 


#### ⁵ Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.” 


#### ⁵ So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 


#### ⁶ He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great abominations.” 


#### ⁷ He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. ⁸ Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.” 


#### ⁸ When I had dug in the wall, I saw a door. 


#### ⁹ He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.” 


#### ¹⁰ So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall. ¹¹ Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up. 


#### ¹² Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? For they say, ‘Yahweh doesn’t see us. Yahweh has forsaken the land.’ ” ¹³ He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations which they do.” 


#### ¹⁴ Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh’s house which was toward the north; and I saw the women sit there weeping for Tammuz. ¹⁵ Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see yet greater abominations than these.” 


#### ¹⁶ He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh’s house; and I saw at the door of Yahweh’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward Yahweh’s temple, and their faces toward the east. They were worshiping the sun toward the east. 


#### ¹⁷ Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger. Behold, they put the branch to their nose. ¹⁸ Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.” 

# Ezekiel 9

#### ¹ Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.” ² Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar. 


#### ³ The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side. ⁴ Yahweh said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done within it.” 


#### ⁵ To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have pity. ⁶ Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” 


#### ⁶ Then they began at the old men who were before the house. 


#### ⁷ He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” 


#### ⁷ They went out, and struck in the city. ⁸ While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?” 


#### ⁹ Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn’t see.’ ¹⁰ As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.” 


#### ¹¹ Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you have commanded me.” 

# Ezekiel 10

#### ¹ Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. ² He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” 


#### ² He went in as I watched. ³ Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. ⁴ Yahweh’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s glory. ⁵ The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks. 


#### ⁶ It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” that he went in, and stood beside a wheel. ⁷ The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out. ⁸ The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings. 


#### ⁹ I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone. ¹⁰ As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel. ¹¹ When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t turn as they went. ¹² Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had. ¹³ As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”. ¹⁴ Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle. 


#### ¹⁵ The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar. ¹⁶ When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them. ¹⁷ When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them. 


#### ¹⁸ Yahweh’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim. ¹⁹ The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 


#### ²⁰ This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. ²¹ Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. ²² As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward. 

# Ezekiel 11

#### ¹ Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Yahweh’s house, which looks eastward. Behold, twenty-five men were at the door of the gate; and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. ² He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city; ³ who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’ ⁴ Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.” 


#### ⁵ Yahweh’s Spirit fell on me, and he said to me, “Speak, ‘Yahweh says: “Thus you have said, house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. ⁶ You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain. 


#### ⁷ “ ‘Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the meat, and this is the cauldron; but you will be brought out of the middle of it. ⁸ You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ⁹ “I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. ¹⁰ You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. ¹¹ This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle of it. I will judge you in the border of Israel. ¹² You will know that I am Yahweh, for you have not walked in my statutes, You have not executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you.” ’ ” 


#### ¹³ When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?” 


#### ¹⁴ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹⁵ “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from Yahweh. This land has been given to us for a possession.’ ” 


#### ¹⁶ “Therefore say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.” ’ 


#### ¹⁷ “Therefore say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.” 


#### ¹⁸ “ ‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there. ¹⁹ I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; ²⁰ that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God. ²¹ But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way on their own heads,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.” 


#### ²² Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them. The glory of the God of Israel was over them above. ²³ Yahweh’s glory went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city. ²⁴ The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the captives. 


#### ²⁴ So the vision that I had seen went up from me. ²⁵ Then I spoke to the captives all the things that Yahweh had shown me. 

# Ezekiel 12

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word also came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear, and don’t hear; for they are a rebellious house. 


#### ³ “Therefore, you son of man, prepare your stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. You shall move from your place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house. ⁴ You shall bring out your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. You shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as when men go out into exile. ⁵ Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your stuff out that way. ⁶ In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face, so that you don’t see the land, for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.” 


#### ⁷ I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight. 


#### ⁸ In the morning, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ⁹ “Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 


#### ¹⁰ “Say to them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.” ’ 


#### ¹¹ “Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity. 


#### ¹² “ ‘The prince who is among them will bear on his shoulder in the dark, and will go out. They will dig through the wall to carry things out that way. He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes. ¹³ I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. ¹⁴ I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his bands. I will draw out the sword after them. 


#### ¹⁵ “ ‘They will know that I am Yahweh when I disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries. ¹⁶ But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ¹⁷ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹⁸ “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness. ¹⁹ Tell the people of the land, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: “They will eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that is therein, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein. ²⁰ The cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 


#### ²¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ²² “Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?’ ²³ Tell them therefore, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel;” ’ but tell them, ‘ “The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision. ²⁴ For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. ²⁵ For I am Yahweh. I will speak, and the word that I speak will be performed. It will be no more deferred; for in your days, rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ²⁶ Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ²⁷ “Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.’ 


#### ²⁸ “Therefore tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “None of my words will be deferred any more, but the word which I speak will be performed,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 13

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word: ³ The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says, “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! ⁴ Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places. ⁵ You have not gone up into the gaps or built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in Yahweh’s day. ⁶ They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but Yahweh has not sent them. They have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed. ⁷ Haven’t you seen a false vision, and haven’t you spoken a lying divination, in that you say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but I have not spoken?” 


#### ⁸ “ ‘Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ⁹ “My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who utter lying divinations. They will not be in the council of my people, neither will they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.” 


#### ¹⁰ “ ‘Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace;” and there is no peace. When one builds up a wall, behold, they plaster it with whitewash. ¹¹ Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will be an overflowing shower; and you, great hailstones, will fall. A stormy wind will tear it. ¹² Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it?” 


#### ¹³ “ ‘Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath. There will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it. ¹⁴ So I will break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered. It will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. ¹⁵ Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered it with whitewash. I will tell you, ‘The wall is no more, neither those who plastered it; ¹⁶ to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,’ ” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ¹⁷ You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them, ¹⁸ and say, “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Woe to the women who sew pillows on all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves? ¹⁹ You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’ 


#### ²⁰ “Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms. I will let the souls go, even the souls whom you hunt to make them fly. ²¹ I will also tear your kerchiefs, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they will be no more in your hand to be hunted. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. ²² Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive. ²³ Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 14

#### ¹ Then some of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me. ² Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ³ “Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. Should I be inquired of at all by them? ⁴ Therefore speak to them, and tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I Yahweh will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols; ⁵ that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.” ’ 


#### ⁶ “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Return, and turn yourselves from your idols! Turn away your faces from all your abominations. 


#### ⁷ “ ‘ “For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live in Israel, who separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Yahweh will answer him by myself. ⁸ I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from among my people. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. 


#### ⁹ “ ‘ “If the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, Yahweh, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from among my people Israel. ¹⁰ They will bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet will be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him; ¹¹ that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ¹² Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹³ “Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of its bread, and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and animal; ¹⁴ though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ¹⁵ “If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it is made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the animals; ¹⁶ though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate. 


#### ¹⁷ “Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and animal;’ ¹⁸ though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only would be delivered themselves. 


#### ¹⁹ “Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal; ²⁰ though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness.” 


#### ²¹ For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “How much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, the famine, the evil animals, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and animal! ²² Yet, behold, there will be left a remnant in it that will be carried out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they will come out to you, and you will see their way and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it. ²³ They will comfort you, when you see their way and their doings; then you will know that I have not done all that I have done in it without cause,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 

# Ezekiel 15

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest? ³ Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it? ⁴ Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and the middle of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work? ⁵ Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it has been burned, will it yet be suitable for any work?” 


#### ⁶ Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. ⁷ I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the fire will devour them. Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them. ⁸ I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 

# Ezekiel 16

#### ¹ Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations; ³ and say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite. An Amorite was your father, and your mother was a Hittite. ⁴ As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. You weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. You weren’t salted at all, nor wrapped in blankets at all. ⁵ No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, because you were abhorred in the day that you were born. 


#### ⁶ “ ‘ “When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ ⁷ I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent ornament. Your breasts were formed, and your hair grew; yet you were naked and bare. 


#### ⁸ “ ‘ “Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “and you became mine. 


#### ⁹ “ ‘ “Then washed I you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil. ¹⁰ I clothed you also with embroidered work, and put sealskin sandals on you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered you with silk. ¹¹ I decked you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and put a chain on your neck. ¹² I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. ¹³ Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered work. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate. ¹⁴ Your renown went out among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ¹⁵ “ ‘ “But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by. It was his. ¹⁶ You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors, and played the prostitute on them. This shall not happen, neither shall it be. ¹⁷ You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and played the prostitute with them. ¹⁸ You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them. ¹⁹ My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma; and so it was,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ²⁰ “ ‘ “Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter, ²¹ that you have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them? ²² In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were wallowing in your blood. 


#### ²³ “ ‘ “It has happened after all your wickedness. Woe, woe to you!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, ²⁴ “that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street. ²⁵ You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution. ²⁶ You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger. ²⁷ See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your portion, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way. ²⁸ You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren’t satisfied. ²⁹ You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren’t satisfied with this. 


#### ³⁰ “ ‘ “How weak is your heart,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute; ³¹ in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay. 


#### ³² “ ‘ “A wife who commits adultery! Who takes strangers instead of her husband! ³³ People give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution. ³⁴ You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.” ’ 


#### ³⁵ “Therefore, prostitute, hear Yahweh’s word: ³⁶ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says, “Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them; ³⁷ therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved, with all those who you have hated. I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. ³⁸ I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. ³⁹ I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places. They will strip you of your clothes, and take your beautiful jewels. They will leave you naked and bare. ⁴⁰ They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords. ⁴¹ They will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute, and you will also give no hire any more. ⁴² So I will cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you. I will be quiet, and will not be angry any more. 


#### ⁴³ “ ‘ “Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way on your head,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh: “and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations. 


#### ⁴⁴ “ ‘ “Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’ ⁴⁵ You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. ⁴⁶ Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, is Sodom with her daughters. ⁴⁷ Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor done their abominations; but soon you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. ⁴⁸ As I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters. 


#### ⁴⁹ “ ‘ “Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters. She also didn’t strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. ⁵⁰ They were arrogant, and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away when I saw it. ⁵¹ Samaria hasn’t committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done. ⁵² You also bear your own shame yourself, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you. Yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters. 


#### ⁵³ “ ‘ “I will reverse their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives among them; ⁵⁴ that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them. ⁵⁵ Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate. ⁵⁶ For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride, ⁵⁷ before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you all around. ⁵⁸ You have borne your lewdness and your abominations,” says Yahweh. 


#### ⁵⁹ “ ‘For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant. ⁶⁰ Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant. ⁶¹ Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant. ⁶² I will establish my covenant with you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh; ⁶³ that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 17

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, tell a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel; ³ and say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “A great eagle with great wings and long feathers, full of feathers, which had various colors, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar. ⁴ He cropped off the topmost of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of traffic. He planted it in a city of merchants. 


#### ⁵ “ ‘ “He also took some of the seed of the land, and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree. ⁶ It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine, produced branches, and shot out sprigs. 


#### ⁷ “ ‘ “There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot out its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it. ⁸ It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might produce branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a good vine.” ’ 


#### ⁹ “Say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Will it prosper? Won’t he pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? It can’t be raised from its roots by a strong arm or many people. ¹⁰ Yes, behold, being planted, will it prosper? Won’t it utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the beds where it grew.” ’ ” 


#### ¹¹ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹² “Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Don’t you know what these things mean?’ Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to him to Babylon. ¹³ He took some of the royal offspring, and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land; ¹⁴ that the kingdom might be brought low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand. ¹⁵ But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the covenant, and still escape? 


#### ¹⁶ “ ‘As I live,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he will die. ¹⁷ Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company won’t help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons. ¹⁸ For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things. He won’t escape. 


#### ¹⁹ “Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘As I live, I will surely bring on his own head my oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken. ²⁰ I will spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me. ²¹ All his fugitives in all his bands will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered toward every wind. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.’ 


#### ²² “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘I will also take some of the lofty top of the cedar, and will plant it. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain. ²³ I will plant it in the mountain of the height of Israel; and it will produce boughs, and bear fruit, and be a good cedar. Birds of every kind will dwell in the shade of its branches. ²⁴ All the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree flourish.

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying, ² “What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, 

² ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, ² and the children’s teeth are set on edge’? 
#### ³ “As I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “you shall not use this proverb any more in Israel. ⁴ Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul who sins, he shall die. 

⁵ “But if a man is just, ⁵ and does that which is lawful and right, ⁶ and has not eaten on the mountains, ⁶ hasn’t lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, ⁶ hasn’t defiled his neighbor’s wife, ⁶ hasn’t come near a woman in her impurity, ⁷ and has not wronged any, ⁷ but has restored to the debtor his pledge, ⁷ has taken nothing by robbery, ⁷ has given his bread to the hungry, ⁷ and has covered the naked with a garment; ⁸ he who hasn’t lent to them with interest, ⁸ hasn’t taken any increase from them, ⁸ who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, ⁸ has executed true justice between man and man, ⁹ has walked in my statutes, ⁹ and has kept my ordinances, ⁹ to deal truly; ⁹ he is just, ⁹ he shall surely live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 
#### ¹⁰ “If he fathers a son who is a robber who sheds blood, and who does any one of these things, ¹¹ or who does not do any of those things, 

¹¹ but even has eaten at the mountain shrines, ¹¹ and defiled his neighbor’s wife, ¹² has wronged the poor and needy, ¹² has taken by robbery, ¹² has not restored the pledge, ¹² and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, ¹² has committed abomination, ¹³ has lent with interest, ¹³ and has taken increase from the poor; ¹³ shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations. He shall surely die. His blood will be on him. 
#### ¹⁴ “Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father’s sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not such like; 

¹⁵ who hasn’t eaten on the mountains, ¹⁵ hasn’t lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, ¹⁵ hasn’t defiled his neighbor’s wife, ¹⁶ hasn’t wronged any, ¹⁶ hasn’t taken anything to pledge, ¹⁶ hasn’t taken by robbery, ¹⁶ but has given his bread to the hungry, ¹⁶ and has covered the naked with a garment; ¹⁷ who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, ¹⁷ who hasn’t received interest or increase, ¹⁷ has executed my ordinances, ¹⁷ has walked in my statutes; ¹⁷ he shall not die for the iniquity of his father. He shall surely live. ¹⁸ As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he will die in his iniquity. 
#### ¹⁹ “Yet you say, ‘Why doesn’t the son bear the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he will surely live. ²⁰ The soul who sins, he shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him. 


#### ²¹ “But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die. ²² None of his transgressions that he has committed will be remembered against him. In his righteousness that he has done, he shall live. ²³ Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh; “and not rather that he should return from his way, and live? 


#### ²⁴ “But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, should he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done will be remembered. In his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die. 


#### ²⁵ “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lᴏʀᴅ is not equal.’ Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren’t your ways unequal? ²⁶ When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity that he has done he shall die. ²⁷ Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he will save his soul alive. ²⁸ Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall not die. ²⁹ Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lᴏʀᴅ is not fair.’ House of Israel, aren’t my ways fair? Aren’t your ways unfair? 


#### ³⁰ “Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. “Return, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity will not be your ruin. ³¹ Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, house of Israel? ³² For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. “Therefore turn yourselves, and live! 

# Ezekiel 19

#### ¹ “Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, ² and say, 

² ‘What was your mother? ² A lioness. ² She couched among lions, ² in the middle of the young lions she nourished her cubs. ³ She brought up one of her cubs. ³ He became a young lion. ³ He learned to catch the prey. ³ He devoured men. ⁴ The nations also heard of him. ⁴ He was taken in their pit; ⁴ and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. ⁵ “ ‘Now when she saw that she had waited, ⁵ and her hope was lost, ⁵ then she took another of her cubs, ⁵ and made him a young lion. ⁶ He went up and down among the lions. ⁶ He became a young lion. ⁶ He learned to catch the prey. ⁶ He devoured men. ⁷ He knew their palaces, ⁷ and laid waste their cities. ⁷ The land was desolate, ⁷ with its fullness, ⁷ because of the noise of his roaring. ⁸ Then the nations attacked him on every side from the provinces. ⁸ They spread their net over him. ⁸ He was taken in their pit. ⁹ They put him in a cage with hooks, ⁹ and brought him to the king of Babylon. ⁹ They brought him into strongholds, ⁹ so that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel. ¹⁰ “ ‘Your mother was like a vine ¹⁰ in your blood, ¹⁰ planted by the waters. ¹⁰ It was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. ¹¹ It had strong branches for the scepters of those who ruled. ¹¹ Their stature was exalted among the thick boughs. ¹¹ They were seen in their height ¹¹ with the multitude of their branches. ¹² But it was plucked up in fury. ¹² It was cast down to the ground, ¹² and the east wind dried up its fruit. ¹² Its strong branches were broken off and withered. ¹² The fire consumed them. ¹³ Now it is planted in the wilderness, ¹³ in a dry and thirsty land. ¹⁴ Fire has gone out of its branches. ¹⁴ It has devoured its fruit, ¹⁴ so that there is in it no strong branch to be a scepter to rule.’ ¹⁴ This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.” # Ezekiel 20

#### ¹ In the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh, and sat before me. 


#### ² Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ³ “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Is it to inquire of me that you have come? As I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “I will not be inquired of by you.” ’ 


#### ⁴ “Will you judge them, son of man? Will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers. ⁵ Tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, ‘I am Yahweh your God;’ ⁶ in that day I swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. ⁷ I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’ 


#### ⁸ “ ‘ “But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes. They also didn’t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt. ⁹ But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. ¹⁰ So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. ¹¹ I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them. ¹² Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them. 


#### ¹³ “ ‘ “But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them. ¹⁴ But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. ¹⁵ Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; ¹⁶ because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. ¹⁷ Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them. I didn’t make a full end of them in the wilderness. ¹⁸ I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers. Don’t observe their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols. ¹⁹ I am Yahweh your God. Walk in my statutes, keep my ordinances, and do them. ²⁰ Make my Sabbaths holy. They shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.’ 


#### ²¹ “ ‘ “But the children rebelled against me. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and didn’t keep my ordinances to do them, which if a man does, he shall live in them. They profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. ²² Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. ²³ Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; ²⁴ because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols. ²⁵ Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live. ²⁶ I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.” ’ 


#### ²⁷ “Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Moreover, in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. ²⁸ For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There they also made their pleasant aroma, and there they poured out their drink offerings. ²⁹ Then I said to them, ‘What does the high place where you go mean?’ So its name is called Bamah to this day.” ’ 


#### ³⁰ “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? Do you play the prostitute after their abominations? ³¹ When you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? Should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live, says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, I will not be inquired of by you! 


#### ³² “ ‘ “That which comes into your mind will not be at all, in that you say, ‘We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.’ ³³ As I live, says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you. ³⁴ I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out. ³⁵ I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face. ³⁶ Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ³⁷ “I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. ³⁸ I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who disobey me. I will bring them out of the land where they live, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” 


#### ³⁹ “ ‘As for you, house of Israel, the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Go, everyone serve his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me; but you shall no more profane my holy name with your gifts and with your idols. ⁴⁰ For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the first fruits of your offerings, with all your holy things. ⁴¹ I will accept you as a pleasant aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered. I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. ⁴² You will know that I am Yahweh when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I swore to give to your fathers. ⁴³ There you will remember your ways, and all your deeds in which you have polluted yourselves. Then you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed. ⁴⁴ You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, you house of Israel,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ⁴⁵ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ⁴⁶ “Son of man, set your face toward the south, and preach toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South. ⁴⁷ Tell the forest of the South, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word: The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says, “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree. The burning flame will not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north will be burned by it. ⁴⁸ All flesh will see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it. It will not be quenched.” ’ ” 


#### ⁴⁹ Then I said, “Ah Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh! They say of me, ‘Isn’t he a speaker of parables?’ ” 

# Ezekiel 21

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel. ³ Tell the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, and will draw my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. ⁴ Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword will go out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north. ⁵ All flesh will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn my sword out of its sheath. It will not return any more.” ’ 


#### ⁶ “Therefore sigh, you son of man. You shall sigh before their eyes with a broken heart and with bitterness. ⁷ It shall be, when they ask you, ‘Why do you sigh?’ that you shall say, ‘Because of the news, for it comes! Every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ⁸ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ⁹ “Son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says: 

⁹ “A sword! A sword! ⁹ It is sharpened, ⁹ and also polished. ¹⁰ It is sharpened that it may make a slaughter. ¹⁰ It is polished that it may be as lightning. ¹⁰ Should we then make mirth? ¹⁰ The rod of my son condemns every tree. ¹¹ It is given to be polished, ¹¹ that it may be handled. ¹¹ The sword is sharpened. ¹¹ Yes, it is polished ¹¹ to give it into the hand of the killer.” ’ ¹² Cry and wail, son of man; ¹² for it is on my people. ¹² It is on all the princes of Israel. ¹² They are delivered over to the sword with my people. ¹² Therefore beat your thigh. 
#### ¹³ “For there is a trial. What if even the rod that condemns will be no more?” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 

¹⁴ “You therefore, son of man, prophesy, ¹⁴ and strike your hands together. ¹⁴ Let the sword be doubled the third time, ¹⁴ the sword of the fatally wounded. ¹⁴ It is the sword of the great one who is fatally wounded, ¹⁴ which enters into their rooms. ¹⁵ I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, ¹⁵ that their heart may melt, ¹⁵ and their stumblings be multiplied. ¹⁵ Ah! It is made as lightning. ¹⁵ It is pointed for slaughter. ¹⁶ Gather yourselves together. ¹⁶ Go to the right. ¹⁶ Set yourselves in array. ¹⁶ Go to the left, ¹⁶ wherever your face is set. ¹⁷ I will also strike my hands together, ¹⁷ and I will cause my wrath to rest. ¹⁷ I, Yahweh, have spoken it.” 
#### ¹⁸ Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying, ¹⁹ “Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. They both will come out of one land, and mark out a place. Mark it out at the head of the way to the city. ²⁰ You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified. ²¹ For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows back and forth. He consulted the teraphim. He looked in the liver. ²² In his right hand was the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, and to build forts. ²³ It will be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken. 


#### ²⁴ “Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Because you have caused your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to memory, you will be taken with the hand. 


#### ²⁵ “ ‘You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end, ²⁶ the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Remove the turban, and take off the crown. This will not be as it was. Exalt that which is low, and humble that which is high. ²⁷ I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also will be no more, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it.” ’ 


#### ²⁸ “You, son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says this concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach: 

²⁸ “A sword! A sword is drawn! ²⁸ It is polished for the slaughter, ²⁸ to cause it to devour, ²⁸ that it may be as lightning; ²⁹ while they see for you false visions, ²⁹ while they divine lies to you, ²⁹ to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, ²⁹ whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end. ³⁰ Cause it to return into its sheath. ³⁰ In the place where you were created, ³⁰ in the land of your birth, I will judge you. ³¹ I will pour out my indignation on you. ³¹ I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath. ³¹ I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, ³¹ skillful to destroy. ³² You will be for fuel to the fire. ³² Your blood will be in the middle of the land. ³² You will be remembered no more; ³² for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.” ’ ” # Ezekiel 22

#### ¹ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “You, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations. ³ You shall say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “A city that sheds blood within herself, that her time may come, and that makes idols against herself to defile her! ⁴ You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed, and are defiled in your idols which you have made! You have caused your days to draw near, and have come even to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all the countries. ⁵ Those who are near, and those who are far from you, will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult. 


#### ⁶ “ ‘ “Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power, have been in you to shed blood. ⁷ In you have they treated father and mother with contempt. Among you they have oppressed the foreigner. In you they have wronged the fatherless and the widow. ⁸ You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths. ⁹ Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood. In you they have eaten on the mountains. They have committed lewdness among you. ¹⁰ In you have they uncovered their fathers’ nakedness. In you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity. ¹¹ One has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. Another in you has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter. ¹² In you have they taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ¹³ “ ‘ “Behold, therefore I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been within you. ¹⁴ Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I will deal with you? I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and will do it. ¹⁵ I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through the countries. I will consume your filthiness out of you. ¹⁶ You will be profaned in yourself, in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 


#### ¹⁷ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹⁸ “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead in the middle of the furnace. They are the dross of silver. ¹⁹ Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the middle of Jerusalem. ²⁰ As they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you. ²¹ Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the middle of it. ²² As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so you will be melted in the middle of it; and you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you.’ ” 


#### ²³ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ²⁴ “Son of man, tell her, ‘You are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained on in the day of indignation.’ ²⁵ There is a conspiracy of her prophets within it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey. They have devoured souls. They take treasure and precious things. They have made many widows within it. ²⁶ Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from my Sabbaths. So I am profaned among them. ²⁷ Her princes within it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain. ²⁸ Her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says,’ when Yahweh has not spoken. ²⁹ The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery. Yes, they have troubled the poor and needy, and have oppressed the foreigner wrongfully. 


#### ³⁰ “I sought for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. ³¹ Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have brought their own way on their heads,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 

# Ezekiel 23

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, ² “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother. ³ They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their youthful nipples were caressed there. ⁴ Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. 


#### ⁵ “Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors, ⁶ who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. ⁷ She gave herself as a prostitute to them, all of them the choicest men of Assyria. She defiled herself with the idols of whoever she lusted after. ⁸ She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They caressed her youthful nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her. 


#### ⁹ “Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted. ¹⁰ These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters; and they killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her. 


#### ¹¹ “Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting than she, and in her prostitution which was more depraved than the prostitution of her sister. ¹² She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. ¹³ I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way. 


#### ¹⁴ “She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with red, ¹⁵ dressed with belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth. ¹⁶ As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them into Chaldea. ¹⁷ The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution. She was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them. ¹⁸ So she uncovered her prostitution and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just like my soul was alienated from her sister. ¹⁹ Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt. ²⁰ She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. ²¹ Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing of your nipples by the Egyptians because of your youthful breasts. 


#### ²² “Therefore, Oholibah, the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side: ²³ the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. ²⁴ They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you with buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their judgments. ²⁵ I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will take away your nose and your ears. Your remnant will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and the rest of you will be devoured by the fire. ²⁶ They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your beautiful jewels. ²⁷ Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution from the land of Egypt; so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.’ 


#### ²⁸ “For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated. ²⁹ They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution. ³⁰ These things will be done to you, because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols. ³¹ You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.’ 


#### ³² “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: 

³² ‘You will drink of your sister’s cup, ³² which is deep and large. ³² You will be ridiculed and held in derision. ³² It contains much. ³³ You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, ³³ with the cup of astonishment and desolation, ³³ with the cup of your sister Samaria. ³⁴ You will even drink it and drain it out. ³⁴ You will gnaw the broken pieces of it, ³⁴ and will tear your breasts; ³⁴ for I have spoken it,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 
#### ³⁵ “Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution.’ ” 


#### ³⁶ Yahweh said moreover to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations. ³⁷ For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured. ³⁸ Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths. ³⁹ For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, they have done this in the middle of my house. 


#### ⁴⁰ “Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments, ⁴¹ and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil. 


#### ⁴² “The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads. ⁴³ Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the prostitute with her, and she with them.’ ⁴⁴ They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women. ⁴⁵ Righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. 


#### ⁴⁶ “For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘I will bring up a mob against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed. ⁴⁷ The company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords.

#### ⁴⁸ “ ‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to be lewd like you. ⁴⁹ They will recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of your idols. Then you will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 24

#### ¹ Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day. ³ Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says, 

³ “Put the cauldron on the fire. ³ Put it on, ³ and also pour water into it. ⁴ Gather its pieces into it, ⁴ even every good piece: ⁴ the thigh and the shoulder. ⁴ Fill it with the choice bones. ⁵ Take the choice of the flock, ⁵ and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron. ⁵ Make it boil well. ⁵ Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.” ⁶ “ ‘Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ⁶ “Woe to the bloody city, ⁶ to the cauldron whose rust is in it, ⁶ and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it! ⁶ Take out of it piece after piece. ⁶ No lot is fallen on it. ⁷ “ ‘ “For her blood is in the middle of her. ⁷ She set it on the bare rock. ⁷ She didn’t pour it on the ground, ⁷ to cover it with dust. ⁸ That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, ⁸ I have set her blood on the bare rock, ⁸ that it should not be covered.” ⁹ “ ‘Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ⁹ “Woe to the bloody city! ⁹ I also will make the pile great. ¹⁰ Heap on the wood. ¹⁰ Make the fire hot. ¹⁰ Boil the meat well. ¹⁰ Make the broth thick, ¹⁰ and let the bones be burned. ¹¹ Then set it empty on its coals, ¹¹ that it may be hot, ¹¹ and its bronze may burn, ¹¹ and that its filthiness may be molten in it, ¹¹ that its rust may be consumed. ¹² She is weary with toil; ¹² yet her great rust, ¹² rust by fire, doesn’t leave her. 
#### ¹³ “ ‘ “In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest. 


#### ¹⁴ I, Yahweh, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways, and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ¹⁵ Also Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹⁶ “Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down. ¹⁷ Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.” 


#### ¹⁸ So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded. 


#### ¹⁹ The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?” 


#### ²⁰ Then I said to them, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ²¹ ‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword. ²² You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread. ²³ Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another. ²⁴ Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” ’ ” 


#### ²⁵ “You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters, ²⁶ that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears? ²⁷ In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak, and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.” 

# Ezekiel 25

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them. ³ Tell the children of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh!

They will set their encampments in you, and make their dwellings in you.

#### ¹² “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and taken revenge on them;” ¹³ therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says, “I will stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and animal from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman. They will fall by the sword even to Dedan. ¹⁴ I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel. They will do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath. Then they will know my vengeance,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ¹⁵ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Because the Philistines have taken revenge, and have taken vengeance with contempt of soul to destroy with perpetual hostility;” ¹⁶ therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says, “Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. ¹⁷ I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes.

I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock. ⁵ She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have spoken it,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ‘She will become plunder for the nations. ⁶ Her daughters who are in the field will be slain with the sword. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ 


#### ⁷ “For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, with chariots, with horsemen, and an army with many people. ⁸ He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword. He will make forts against you, cast up a mound against you, and raise up the buckler against you. ⁹ He will set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. ¹⁰ By reason of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he enters into your gates, as men enter into a city which is broken open. ¹¹ He will tread down all your streets with the hoofs of his horses. He will kill your people with the sword. The pillars of your strength will go down to the ground. ¹² They will make a plunder of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise. They will break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses. They will lay your stones, your timber, and your dust in the middle of the waters. ¹³ I will cause the noise of your songs to cease. The sound of your harps won’t be heard any more. ¹⁴ I will make you a bare rock. You will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more; for I Yahweh have spoken it,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ¹⁵ “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says to Tyre: ‘Won’t the islands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made within you? ¹⁶ Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling. They will sit on the ground, and will tremble every moment, and be astonished at you. ¹⁷ They will take up a lamentation over you, and tell you, 

¹⁷ “How you are destroyed, ¹⁷ who were inhabited by seafaring men, ¹⁷ the renowned city, ¹⁷ who was strong in the sea, ¹⁷ she and her inhabitants, ¹⁷ who caused their terror to be on all who lived there!” ¹⁸ Now the islands will tremble in the day of your fall. ¹⁸ Yes, the islands that are in the sea will be dismayed at your departure.’ 
#### ¹⁹ “For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I bring up the deep on you, and the great waters cover you; ²⁰ then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living. ²¹ I will make you a terror, and you will no more have any being.

² ‘Whom are you like in your greatness? ³ Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon ³ with beautiful branches, ³ and with a forest-like shade, ³ of high stature; ³ and its top was among the thick boughs. ⁴ The waters nourished it. ⁴ The deep made it to grow. ⁴ Its rivers ran all around its plantation; ⁴ and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field. ⁵ Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; ⁵ and its boughs were multiplied. ⁵ Its branches became long by reason of many waters, ⁵ when it spread them out. ⁶ All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs. ⁶ Under its branches, all the animals of the field gave birth to their young. ⁶ All great nations lived under its shadow. ⁷ Thus it was beautiful in its greatness, ⁷ in the length of its branches; ⁷ for its root was by many waters. ⁸ The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it. ⁸ The cypress trees were not like its boughs. ⁸ The pine trees were not as its branches; ⁸ nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty. ⁹ I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, ⁹ so that all the trees of Eden, ⁹ that were in the garden of God, envied it.’ 
#### ¹⁰ “Therefore thus said the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh: ‘Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; ¹¹ I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He will surely deal with him. I have driven him out for his wickedness. ¹² Strangers, the tyrants of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him. His branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. All the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have left him. ¹³ All the birds of the sky will dwell on his ruin, and all the animals of the field will be on his branches; ¹⁴ to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, and don’t set their top among the thick boughs. Their mighty ones don’t stand up on their height, even all who drink water; for they are all delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.’ 


#### ¹⁵ “The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘In the day when he went down to Sheol  I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers. The great waters were stopped. I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him. ¹⁶ I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit. All the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth. ¹⁷ They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, who lived under his shadow in the middle of the nations. 


#### ¹⁸ “ ‘To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You will lie in the middle of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. 


#### ¹⁸ “ ‘This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.” 

# Ezekiel 32

#### ¹ In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² ‘Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him, 

² “You were likened to a young lion of the nations; ² yet you are as a monster in the seas. ² You broke out with your rivers, ² and troubled the waters with your feet, ² and fouled their rivers.” ³ The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ³ “I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples; ³ and they will bring you up in my net. ⁴ I will leave you on the land. ⁴ I will cast you out on the open field, ⁴ and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you. ⁴ I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you. ⁵ I will lay your flesh on the mountains, ⁵ and fill the valleys with your height. ⁶ I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood, ⁶ even to the mountains. ⁶ The watercourses will be full of you. ⁷ When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens ⁷ and make its stars dark. ⁷ I will cover the sun with a cloud, ⁷ and the moon won’t give its light. ⁸ I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you, ⁸ and set darkness on your land,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ⁹ “I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, ⁹ when I bring your destruction among the nations, ⁹ into the countries which you have not known. ¹⁰ Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, ¹⁰ and their kings will be horribly afraid for you, ¹⁰ when I brandish my sword before them. ¹⁰ They will tremble at every moment, ¹⁰ every man for his own life, ¹⁰ in the day of your fall.” ¹¹ For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ¹¹ “The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you. ¹² I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty. ¹² They are all the ruthless of the nations. ¹² They will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing, ¹² and all its multitude will be destroyed. ¹³ I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters. ¹³ The foot of man won’t trouble them any more, ¹³ nor will the hoofs of animals trouble them. ¹⁴ Then I will make their waters clear, ¹⁴ and cause their rivers to run like oil,” ¹⁴ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ¹⁵ “When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, ¹⁵ a land destitute of that of which it was full, ¹⁵ when I strike all those who dwell therein, ¹⁵ then they will know that I am Yahweh. 
#### ¹⁶ “ ‘ “This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with this. They will lament with it over Egypt, and over all her multitude,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ¹⁷ Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹⁸ “Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit. ¹⁹ Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised. ²⁰ They will fall among those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away with all her multitudes. ²¹ The strong among the mighty will speak to him out of the middle of Sheol  with those who help him. They have gone down. The uncircumcised lie still, slain by the sword. 


#### ²² “Asshur is there with all her company. Her graves are all around her. All of them slain, fallen by the sword; ²³ whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living. 


#### ²⁴ “There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. ²⁵ They have set her a bed among the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are around her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. He is put among those who are slain. 


#### ²⁶ “There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are around them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living. ²⁷ They will not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. 


#### ²⁸ “But you will be broken among the uncircumcised, and will lie with those who are slain by the sword. 


#### ²⁹ “There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. They will lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit. 


#### ³⁰ “There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain. They are put to shame in the terror which they caused by their might. They lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit. 


#### ³¹ “Pharaoh will see them, and will be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ³² “For I have put his terror in the land of the living. He will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 

# Ezekiel 33

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman; ³ if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people; ⁴ then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn’t heed the warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. ⁵ He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn’t take warning. His blood will be on him; whereas if he had heeded the warning, he would have delivered his soul. ⁶ But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’ 


#### ⁷ “So you, son of man: I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warnings from me. ⁸ When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at your hand. ⁹ Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. 


#### ¹⁰ “You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: ‘You say this, “Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?” ’ ¹¹ Tell them, ‘ “As I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, house of Israel?” ’ 


#### ¹² “You, son of man, tell the children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his disobedience. And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither will he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins. ¹³ When I tell the righteous that he will surely live; if he trusts in his righteousness, and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but he will die in his iniquity that he has committed. ¹⁴ Again, when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die;” if he turns from his sin, and does that which is lawful and right; ¹⁵ if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he will surely live. He will not die. ¹⁶ None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done that which is lawful and right. He will surely live. 


#### ¹⁷ “ ‘Yet the children of your people say, “The way of the Lᴏʀᴅ is not fair;” but as for them, their way is not fair. ¹⁸ When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he will even die therein. ¹⁹ When the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he will live by it. ²⁰ Yet you say, “The way of the Lᴏʀᴅ is not fair.” House of Israel, I will judge every one of you after his ways.’ ” 


#### ²¹ In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city has been defeated!” ²² Now Yahweh’s hand had been on me in the evening, before he who had escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute. 


#### ²³ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ²⁴ “Son of man, those who inhabit the waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, ‘Abraham was one, and he inherited the land; but we are many. The land is given us for inheritance.’ ²⁵ Therefore tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. So should you possess the land? ²⁶ You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and every one of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. So should you possess the land?” ’ 


#### ²⁷ “You shall tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword. I will give he who is in the open field to the animals to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of the pestilence. ²⁸ I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment. The pride of her power will cease. The mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that no one will pass through. ²⁹ Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.” ’ 


#### ³⁰ “As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk about you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak to one another, everyone to his brother, saying, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes out from Yahweh.’ ³¹ They come to you as the people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don’t do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain. ³² Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they don’t do them. 


#### ³³ “When this comes to pass—behold, it comes—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.” 

# Ezekiel 34

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell them, even the shepherds, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed the sheep? ³ You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fatlings, but you don’t feed the sheep. ⁴ You haven’t strengthened the diseased. You haven’t healed that which was sick. You haven’t bound up that which was broken. You haven’t brought back that which was driven away. You haven’t sought that which was lost, but you have ruled over them with force and with rigor. ⁵ They were scattered, because there was no shepherd. They became food to all the animals of the field, and were scattered. ⁶ My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth. There was no one who searched or sought.” 


#### ⁷ “ ‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: ⁸ “As I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field, because there was no shepherd. My shepherds didn’t search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and didn’t feed my sheep.” ⁹ Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: ¹⁰ The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds. I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. The shepherds won’t feed themselves any more. I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.” 


#### ¹¹ “ ‘For the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. ¹² As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out my sheep. I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. ¹³ I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country. ¹⁴ I will feed them with good pasture; and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel. There they will lie down in a good fold. They will feed on fat pasture on the mountains of Israel. ¹⁵ I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ¹⁶ “I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will feed them in justice.” ’ 


#### ¹⁷ “As for you, O my flock, the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats. ¹⁸ Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? And to have drunk of the clear waters, but must you foul the residue with your feet? ¹⁹ As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.’ 


#### ²⁰ “Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says to them: ‘Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. ²¹ Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad; ²² therefore I will save my flock, and they will no more be a prey. I will judge between sheep and sheep. ²³ I will set up one shepherd over them, and he will feed them, even my servant David. He will feed them, and he will be their shepherd. ²⁴ I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them. I, Yahweh, have spoken it. 


#### ²⁵ “ ‘I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land. They will dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. ²⁶ I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing. I will cause the shower to come down in its season. There will be showers of blessing. ²⁷ The tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure in their land. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those who made slaves of them. ²⁸ They will no more be a prey to the nations, neither will the animals of the earth devour them; but they will dwell securely, and no one will make them afraid. ²⁹ I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they will no more be consumed with famine in the land, and not bear the shame of the nations any more. ³⁰ They will know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ³¹ You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.” 

# Ezekiel 35

#### ¹ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, ³ and tell it, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you. I will make you a desolation and an astonishment. ⁴ I will lay your cities waste, and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. 


#### ⁵ “ ‘ “Because you have had a perpetual hostility, and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end; ⁶ therefore, as I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “I will prepare you for blood, and blood will pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, therefore blood will pursue you. ⁷ Thus I will make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation. I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns. ⁸ I will fill its mountains with its slain. The slain with the sword will fall in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses. ⁹ I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. 


#### ¹⁰ “ ‘ “Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two countries will be mine, and we will possess it;’ whereas Yahweh was there: ¹¹ therefore, as I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “I will do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you have shown out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. ¹² You will know that I, Yahweh, have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They have been laid desolate. They have been given us to devour.’ ¹³ You have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me. I have heard it.” ¹⁴ The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. ¹⁵ As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 36

#### ¹ You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, “You mountains of Israel, hear Yahweh’s word. ² The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Because the enemy has said against you, “Aha!” and, “The ancient high places are ours in possession!” ’ ³ therefore prophesy, and say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;” ⁴ therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh: The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are all around; ⁵ therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.” ’ ⁶ Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell the mountains, the hills, the watercourses and the valleys, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne the shame of the nations.” ⁷ Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “I have sworn, ‘Surely the nations that are around you will bear their shame.’ 


#### ⁸ “ ‘ “But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot out your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come. ⁹ For, behold, I am for you, and I will come to you, and you will be tilled and sown. ¹⁰ I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, even all of it. The cities will be inhabited, and the waste places will be built. ¹¹ I will multiply man and animal on you. They will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to be inhabited as you were before, and you will do better than at your beginnings. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. ¹² Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will never again bereave them of their children.” 


#### ¹³ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Because they say to you, ‘You are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of your nation;’ ¹⁴ therefore you shall devour men no more, and not bereave your nation any more,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ¹⁵ “I won’t let you hear the shame of the nations any more. You won’t bear the reproach of the peoples any more, and you won’t cause your nation to stumble any more,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ¹⁶ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ¹⁷ “Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and by their deeds. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. ¹⁸ Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols. ¹⁹ I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their deeds. ²⁰ When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, ‘These are Yahweh’s people, and have left his land.’ ²¹ But I had respect for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went. 


#### ²² “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “I don’t do this for your sake, house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went. ²³ I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “when I am proven holy in you before their eyes. 


#### ²⁴ “ ‘ “For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. ²⁵ I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all your idols. ²⁶ I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. ²⁷ I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them. ²⁸ You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people, and I will be your God. ²⁹ I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you. ³⁰ I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations. 


#### ³¹ “ ‘ “Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. ³² I don’t do this for your sake,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. “Let it be known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, house of Israel.” 


#### ³³ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited and the waste places will be built. ³⁴ The land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a desolation in the sight of all who passed by. ³⁵ They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate, and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’ ³⁶ Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate. I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it.” 


#### ³⁷ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock. ³⁸ As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so the waste cities will be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 

# Ezekiel 37

#### ¹ Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me out in Yahweh’s Spirit, and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones. ² He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry. ³ He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” 


#### ³ I answered, “Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, you know.” 


#### ⁴ Again he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, ‘You dry bones, hear Yahweh’s word. ⁵ The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says to these bones: “Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you will live. ⁶ I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 


#### ⁷ So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, there was an earthquake. Then the bones came together, bone to its bone. ⁸ I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. 


#### ⁹ Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” ’ ” 


#### ¹⁰ So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army. 


#### ¹¹ Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are completely cut off.’ ¹² Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. ¹³ You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people. ¹⁴ I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. Then I will place you in your own land; and you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it,” says Yahweh.’ ” 


#### ¹⁵ Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, ¹⁶ “You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, ‘For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions.’ Then take another stick, and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions.’ ¹⁷ Then join them for yourself to one another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. 


#### ¹⁸ “When the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Won’t you show us what you mean by these?’ ¹⁹ tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand. ²⁰ The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.” ’ ²¹ Say to them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land. ²² I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. One king will be king to them all. They will no longer be two nations. They won’t be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. ²³ They won’t defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they will be my people, and I will be their God. 


#### ²⁴ “ ‘ “My servant David will be king over them. They all will have one shepherd. They will also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them. ²⁵ They will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived. They will dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, forever. David my servant will be their prince forever. ²⁶ Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will place them, multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forever more. ²⁷ My tent also will be with them. I will be their God, and they will be my people. ²⁸ The nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forever more.” ’ ” 

# Ezekiel 38

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ² “Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, ³ and say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. ⁴ I will turn you around, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords; ⁵ Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet; ⁶ Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with you. 


#### ⁷ “ ‘ “Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies who are assembled to you, and be a guard to them. ⁸ After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you will come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought out of the peoples, and they will dwell securely, all of them. ⁹ You will ascend. You will come like a storm. You will be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.” 


#### ¹⁰ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “It will happen in that day that things will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil plan. ¹¹ You will say, ‘I will go up to the land of unwalled villages. I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, ¹² to take the plunder and to take prey; to turn your hand against the waste places that are inhabited, and against the people who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle of the earth.’ ¹³ Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions of it, will ask you, ‘Have you come to take the plunder? Have you assembled your company to take the prey, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder?’ ” ’ 


#### ¹⁴ “Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “In that day when my people Israel dwells securely, will you not know it? ¹⁵ You will come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you, and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army. ¹⁶ You will come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land. It will happen in the latter days, that I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when I am sanctified in you, Gog, before their eyes.” 


#### ¹⁷ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Are you he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for years that I would bring you against them? ¹⁸ It will happen in that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “that my wrath will come up into my nostrils. ¹⁹ For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath I have spoken. Surely in that day there will be a great shaking in the land of Israel; ²⁰ so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, all creeping things who creep on the earth, and all the men who are on the surface of the earth will shake at my presence. Then the mountains will be thrown down, the steep places will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground. ²¹ I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. “Every man’s sword will be against his brother. ²² I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and with blood. I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on the many peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, with great hailstones, fire, and sulfur. ²³ I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ 

# Ezekiel 39

#### ¹ “You, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. ² I will turn you around, and will lead you on, and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring you onto the mountains of Israel. ³ I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand. ⁴ You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your hordes, and the peoples who are with you. I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the animals of the field to be devoured. ⁵ You will fall on the open field; for I have spoken it,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. ⁶ “I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely in the islands. Then they will know that I am Yahweh. 


#### ⁷ “ ‘ “I will make my holy name known among my people Israel. I won’t allow my holy name to be profaned any more. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel. ⁸ Behold, it comes, and it will be done,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. “This is the day about which I have spoken. 


#### ⁹ “ ‘ “Those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out, and will make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the war clubs and the spears, and they will make fires with them for seven years; ¹⁰ so that they will take no wood out of the field, and not cut down any out of the forests; for they will make fires with the weapons. They will plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ¹¹ “ ‘ “It will happen in that day, that I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of those who pass through on the east of the sea; and it will stop those who pass through. They will bury Gog and all his multitude there; and they will call it ‘The valley of Hamon Gog’. 


#### ¹² “ ‘ “The house of Israel will be burying them for seven months, that they may cleanse the land. ¹³ Yes, all the people of the land will bury them; and they will become famous in the day that I will be glorified,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh. 


#### ¹⁴ “ ‘ “They will set apart men of continual employment, who will pass through the land. Those who pass through will go with those who bury those who remain on the surface of the land, to cleanse it. After the end of seven months they will search. ¹⁵ Those who pass through the land will pass through; and when anyone sees a man’s bone, then he will set up a sign by it, until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog. ¹⁶ Hamonah will also be the name of a city. Thus they will cleanse the land.” ’ 


#### ¹⁷ “You, son of man, the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every animal of the field, “Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat meat and drink blood. ¹⁸ You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. ¹⁹ You shall eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. ²⁰ You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.’ 


#### ²¹ “I will set my glory among the nations. Then all the nations will see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them. ²² So the house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God, from that day and forward. ²³ The nations will know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword. ²⁴ I did to them according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions. I hid my face from them. 


#### ²⁵ “Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘Now I will reverse the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel. I will be jealous for my holy name. ²⁶ They will bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwell securely in their land, and no one will make them afraid, ²⁷ when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations. ²⁸ They will know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them to their own land. Then I will leave none of them captive any more. ²⁹ I won’t hide my face from them any more; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.” 

# Ezekiel 40

#### ¹ In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck, in the same day, Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me there. ² In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was something like the frame of a city to the south. ³ He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. ⁴ The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.” 


#### ⁵ Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand width each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. 


#### ⁶ Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide. ⁷ Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. 


#### ⁸ He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. ⁹ Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. 


#### ¹⁰ The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. The posts had one measure on this side and on that side. ¹¹ He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; ¹² and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. ¹³ He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door. ¹⁴ He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate. ¹⁵ From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits. ¹⁶ There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches. Windows were around inward. Palm trees were on each post. 


#### ¹⁷ Then he brought me into the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirty rooms were on the pavement. ¹⁸ The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. ¹⁹ Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north. 


#### ²⁰ He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces toward the north. ²¹ The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side. Its posts and its arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits. ²² Its windows, its arches, and its palm trees were the same as the measure of the gate which faces toward the east. They went up to it by seven steps. Its arches were before them. ²³ There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate. 


#### ²⁴ He led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its posts and its arches according to these measurements. ²⁵ There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits. ²⁶ There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. It had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts. ²⁷ There was a gate to the inner court toward the south. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate toward the south. 


#### ²⁸ Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate according to these measurements; ²⁹ with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide. ³⁰ There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits wide. ³¹ Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts. The ascent to it had eight steps. 


#### ³² He brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured the gate according to these measurements; ³³ with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide. ³⁴ Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps. 


#### ³⁵ He brought me to the north gate, and he measured it according to these measurements; ³⁶ its lodges, its posts, and its arches. There were windows in it all around. The length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. ³⁷ Its posts were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps. 


#### ³⁸ A room with its door was by the posts at the gates. They washed the burnt offering there. ³⁹ In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. ⁴⁰ On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. ⁴¹ Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate: eight tables, on which they killed the sacrifices. ⁴² There were four tables for the burnt offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. They laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them. ⁴³ The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around. The meat of the offering was on the tables. 


#### ⁴⁴ Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate. They faced toward the south. One at the side of the east gate faced toward the north. ⁴⁵ He said to me, “This room, which faces toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the house. ⁴⁶ The room which faces toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him.” ⁴⁷ He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, square. The altar was before the house. 


#### ⁴⁸ Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. ⁴⁹ The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it. There were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. 

# Ezekiel 41

#### ¹ He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tent. ² The width of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits. 


#### ³ Then he went inward and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits. ⁴ He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the temple. He said to me, “This is the most holy place.” 


#### ⁵ Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side. ⁶ The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order. They entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, and not penetrate the wall of the house. ⁷ The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level. 


#### ⁸ I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits. ⁹ The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits. That which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house. ¹⁰ Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side. ¹¹ The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around. 


#### ¹² The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits. 


#### ¹³ So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long; ¹⁴ also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits. 


#### ¹⁵ He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court ¹⁶ the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, opposite the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered), ¹⁷ to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure. ¹⁸ It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces; ¹⁹ so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around. ²⁰ Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The wall of the temple was like this. 


#### ²¹ As for the temple, the door posts were squared. As for the face of the sanctuary, its appearance was as the appearance of the temple. ²² The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before Yahweh.” ²³ The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. ²⁴ The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other. ²⁵ There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like those made on the walls. There was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside. ²⁶ There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. This is how the side rooms of the house and the thresholds were arranged. 

# Ezekiel 42

#### ¹ Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north. Then he brought me into the room that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north. ² Before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits. ³ Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third floor. ⁴ Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north. ⁵ Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middle, in the building. ⁶ For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground. ⁷ The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits. ⁸ For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. Behold, before the temple were one hundred cubits. ⁹ From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court. 


#### ¹⁰ In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were rooms. ¹¹ The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north; according to their length so was their width: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. ¹² According to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them. 


#### ¹³ Then he said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, with the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. ¹⁴ When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but they shall lay their garments in which they minister there; for they are holy. Then they shall put on other garments, and shall approach that which is for the people.” 


#### ¹⁵ Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it all around. ¹⁶ He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around. ¹⁷ He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around. ¹⁸ He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. ¹⁹ He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. ²⁰ He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the width five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common. 

# Ezekiel 43

#### ¹ Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east. ² Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illuminated with his glory. ³ It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. ⁴ Yahweh’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward the east. ⁵ The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled the house. 


#### ⁶ I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me. ⁷ He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places; ⁸ in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door post beside my door post. There was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in my anger. ⁹ Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me. Then I will dwell among them forever. 


#### ¹⁰ “You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. ¹¹ If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them. 


#### ¹² “This is the law of the house. On the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. 


#### ¹³ “These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a hand width): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border around its edge a span; and this shall be the base of the altar. ¹⁴ From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the width a cubit. ¹⁵ The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns. ¹⁶ The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides. ¹⁷ The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit around; and its steps shall look toward the east.” 


#### ¹⁸ He said to me, “Son of man, the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: ‘These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it. ¹⁹ You shall give to the Levitical priests who are of the offspring of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, ‘a young bull for a sin offering. ²⁰ You shall take of its blood, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around. You shall cleanse it and make atonement for it that way. ²¹ You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside of the sanctuary. 


#### ²² “On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull. ²³ When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without defect, and a ram out of the flock without defect. ²⁴ You shall bring them near to Yahweh, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh. 


#### ²⁵ “Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering. They shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without defect. ²⁶ Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it. So shall they consecrate it. ²⁷ When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings. Then I will accept you,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh.” 

# Ezekiel 44

#### ¹ Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut. ² Yahweh said to me, “This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, no man shall enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered in by it.

#### ⁴ Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house; so I fell on my face. 


#### ⁵ Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning all the ordinances of Yahweh’s house, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary. ⁶ You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “You house of Israel, let that be enough of all your abominations, ⁷ in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations. ⁸ You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.” ⁹ The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel. 


#### ¹⁰ “ ‘ “But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity. ¹¹ Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. ¹² Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel. Therefore I have lifted up my hand against them,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh, “and they will bear their iniquity. ¹³ They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. ¹⁴ Yet I will make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service, and for all that will be done therein. 


#### ¹⁵ “ ‘ “But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me.

No wool shall come on them while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. ¹⁸ They shall have linen turbans on their heads, and shall have linen trousers on their waists. They shall not clothe themselves with anything that makes them sweat. ¹⁹ When they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they minister, and lay them in the holy rooms. They shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people with their garments.

#### ²⁸ “ ‘They shall have an inheritance. I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel. I am their possession. ²⁹ They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. ³⁰ The first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every offering of everything, of all your offerings, shall be for the priest. You shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on your house. ³¹ The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it is bird or animal.

#### ¹ “ ‘ “Moreover, when you divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an offering to Yahweh, a holy portion of the land. The length shall be the length of twenty-five thousand reeds, and the width shall be ten thousand. It shall be holy in all its border all around. ² Of this there shall be a five hundred by five hundred square for the holy place; and fifty cubits for its pasture lands all around. ³ Of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand, and a width of ten thousand. In it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy. ⁴ It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Yahweh. It shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. ⁵ Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in width, shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, as a possession for themselves, for twenty rooms.

#### ¹ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. ² The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. ³ The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons. ⁴ The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without defect and a ram without defect; ⁵ and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. ⁶ On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without defect, and six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without defect. ⁷ He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah. ⁸ When the prince enters, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by its way. 


#### ⁹ “ ‘ “But when the people of the land come before Yahweh in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate. He shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him. ¹⁰ The prince shall go in with them when they go in. When they go out, he shall go out. 


#### ¹¹ “ ‘ “In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah  for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. ¹² When the prince prepares a free will offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a free will offering to Yahweh, one shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out; and after his going out one shall shut the gate. 


#### ¹³ “ ‘ “You shall prepare a lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering to Yahweh daily. Morning by morning you shall prepare it. ¹⁴ You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal offering to Yahweh continually by a perpetual ordinance. ¹⁵ Thus they shall prepare the lamb, the meal offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.” 


#### ¹⁶ “ ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It shall belong to his sons. It is their possession by inheritance. ¹⁷ But if he gives of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. ¹⁸ Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession. He shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people not each be scattered from his possession.” ’ ” 


#### ¹⁹ Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, which looked toward the north. Behold, there was a place on the back part westward. ²⁰ He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.” 


#### ²¹ Then he brought me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. ²² In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty cubits long and thirty wide. These four in the corners were the same size. ²³ There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were made under the walls all around. ²⁴ Then he said to me, “These are the boiling houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.” 

# Ezekiel 47

#### ¹ He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters flowed out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the front of the house faced toward the east. The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. ² Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side. 


#### ³ When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. ⁴ Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist. ⁵ Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be walked through. 


#### ⁶ He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen?” 


#### ⁶ Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river. ⁷ Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. ⁸ Then he said to me, “These waters flow out toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah. Then they will go toward the sea; and flow into the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters will be healed. ⁹ It will happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live. Then there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes. ¹⁰ It will happen, that fishermen will stand by it. From En Gedi even to En Eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many. ¹¹ But the miry places of it, and its marshes, will not be healed. They will be given up to salt. ¹² By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf won’t wither, neither will its fruit fail. It will produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.” 


#### ¹³ The Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh says: “This shall be the border, by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions. ¹⁴ You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your fathers. This land will fall to you for inheritance.

This is the north side. 


#### ¹⁸ “The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the east sea you shall measure. This is the east side.
