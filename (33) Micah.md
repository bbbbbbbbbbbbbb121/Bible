# Micah 1

#### ¹ Yahweh’s word that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 


#### ² Hear, you peoples, all of you. ² Listen, O earth, and all that is therein: ² and let the Lᴏʀᴅ Yahweh be witness against you, ² the Lᴏʀᴅ from his holy temple. ³ For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place, ³ and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth. ⁴ The mountains melt under him, ⁴ and the valleys split apart, ⁴ like wax before the fire, ⁴ like waters that are poured down a steep place. ⁵ “All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, ⁵ and for the sins of the house of Israel. ⁵ What is the disobedience of Jacob? ⁵ Isn’t it Samaria? ⁵ And what are the high places of Judah? ⁵ Aren’t they Jerusalem? ⁶ Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field, ⁶ like places for planting vineyards; ⁶ and I will pour down its stones into the valley, ⁶ and I will uncover its foundations. ⁷ All her idols will be beaten to pieces, ⁷ and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire, ⁷ and all her images I will destroy; ⁷ for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them, ⁷ and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.” ⁸ For this I will lament and wail; ⁸ I will go stripped and naked; ⁸ I will howl like the jackals, ⁸ and moan like the daughters of owls. ⁹ For her wounds are incurable; ⁹ for it has come even to Judah. ⁹ It reaches to the gate of my people, ⁹ even to Jerusalem. ¹⁰ Don’t tell it in Gath. ¹⁰ Don’t weep at all. ¹⁰ At Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust. ¹¹ Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. ¹¹ The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out. ¹¹ The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection. ¹² For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, ¹² because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem. ¹³ Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish. ¹³ She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; ¹³ For the transgressions of Israel were found in you. ¹⁴ Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath. ¹⁴ The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel. ¹⁵ I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah. ¹⁵ He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam. ¹⁶ Shave your heads, ¹⁶ and cut off your hair for the children of your delight. ¹⁶ Enlarge your baldness like the vulture; ¹⁶ for they have gone into captivity from you! # Micah 2

#### ¹ Woe to those who devise iniquity 
#### ¹ and work evil on their beds! 
#### ¹ When the morning is light, they practice it, 
#### ¹ because it is in the power of their hand. ² They covet fields, and seize them; ² and houses, and take them away: ² and they oppress a man and his house, ² even a man and his heritage. ³ Therefore Yahweh says: ³ “Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster, ³ from which you will not remove your necks, ³ neither will you walk haughtily; ³ for it is an evil time. ⁴ In that day they will take up a parable against you, ⁴ and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, ⁴ ‘We are utterly ruined! ⁴ My people’s possession is divided up. ⁴ Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’ ” ⁵ Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly. ⁶ “Don’t prophesy!” ⁶ They prophesy. ⁶ “Don’t prophesy about these things. ⁶ Disgrace won’t overtake us.” ⁷ Shall it be said, O house of Jacob: ⁷ “Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry? ⁷ Are these his doings? ⁷ Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?” ⁸ But lately my people have risen up as an enemy. ⁸ You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle. ⁹ You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; ⁹ from their young children you take away my blessing forever. ¹⁰ Arise, and depart! ¹⁰ For this is not your resting place, ¹⁰ because of uncleanness that destroys, ¹⁰ even with a grievous destruction. ¹¹ If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies: ¹¹ “I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;” ¹¹ he would be the prophet of this people. ¹² I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; ¹² I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; ¹² I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, ¹² as a flock in the middle of their pasture; ¹² they will swarm with people. ¹³ He who breaks open the way goes up before them. ¹³ They break through the gate, and go out. ¹³ And their king passes on before them, ¹³ with Yahweh at their head. # Micah 3

#### ¹ I said, 


#### ¹ “Please listen, you heads of Jacob, 
#### ¹ and rulers of the house of Israel: 
#### ¹ Isn’t it for you to know justice? ² You who hate the good, ² and love the evil; ² who tear off their skin, ² and their flesh from off their bones; ³ who also eat the flesh of my people, ³ and peel their skin from off them, ³ and break their bones, ³ and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, ³ and as meat within the cauldron. ⁴ Then they will cry to Yahweh, ⁴ but he will not answer them. ⁴ Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, ⁴ because they made their deeds evil.” 
#### ⁵ Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him: 

⁶ “Therefore night is over you, with no vision, ⁶ and it is dark to you, that you may not divine; ⁶ and the sun will go down on the prophets, ⁶ and the day will be black over them. ⁷ The seers shall be disappointed, ⁷ and the diviners confounded. ⁷ Yes, they shall all cover their lips; ⁷ for there is no answer from God.” ⁸ But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit, ⁸ and of judgment, and of might, ⁸ to declare to Jacob his disobedience, ⁸ and to Israel his sin. ⁹ Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, ⁹ and rulers of the house of Israel, ⁹ who abhor justice, ⁹ and pervert all equity. ¹⁰ They build up Zion with blood, ¹⁰ and Jerusalem with iniquity. ¹¹ Her leaders judge for bribes, ¹¹ and her priests teach for a price, ¹¹ and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money: ¹¹ yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, ¹¹ “Isn’t Yahweh among us? ¹¹ No disaster will come on us.” ¹² Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, ¹² and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, ¹² and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest. # Micah 4

#### ¹ But in the latter days, 
#### ¹ it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains, 
#### ¹ and it will be exalted above the hills; 
#### ¹ and peoples will stream to it. ² Many nations will go and say, ² “Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh, ² and to the house of the God of Jacob; ² and he will teach us of his ways, ² and we will walk in his paths.” ² For the law will go out of Zion, ² and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem; ³ and he will judge between many peoples, ³ and will decide concerning strong nations afar off. ³ They will beat their swords into plowshares, ³ and their spears into pruning hooks. ³ Nation will not lift up sword against nation, ³ neither will they learn war any more. ⁴ But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; ⁴ and no one will make them afraid: ⁴ For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken. ⁵ Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods; ⁵ but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever. ⁶ “In that day,” says Yahweh, ⁶ “I will assemble that which is lame, ⁶ and I will gather that which is driven away, ⁶ and that which I have afflicted; ⁷ and I will make that which was lame a remnant, ⁷ and that which was cast far off a strong nation: ⁷ and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.” ⁸ You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, ⁸ to you it will come, ⁸ yes, the former dominion will come, ⁸ the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem. ⁹ Now why do you cry out aloud? ⁹ Is there no king in you? ⁹ Has your counselor perished, ⁹ that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail? ¹⁰ Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, ¹⁰ like a woman in travail; ¹⁰ for now you will go out of the city, ¹⁰ and will dwell in the field, ¹⁰ and will come even to Babylon. ¹⁰ There you will be rescued. ¹⁰ There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. ¹¹ Now many nations have assembled against you, that say, ¹¹ “Let her be defiled, ¹¹ and let our eye gloat over Zion.” ¹² But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh, ¹² neither do they understand his counsel; ¹² for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor. ¹³ Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion; ¹³ for I will make your horn iron, ¹³ and I will make your hoofs bronze; ¹³ and you will beat in pieces many peoples: ¹³ and I will devote their gain to Yahweh, ¹³ and their substance to the Lᴏʀᴅ of the whole earth. # Micah 5

#### ¹ Now you shall gather yourself in troops, 
#### ¹ daughter of troops. 
#### ¹ He has laid siege against us. 
#### ¹ They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek. ² But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, ² being small among the clans of Judah, ² out of you one will come out to me that is to be ruler in Israel; ² whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times. ³ Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth. ³ Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel. ⁴ He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh, ⁴ in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God: ⁴ and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth. ⁵ He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land, ⁵ and when he marches through our fortresses, ⁵ then we will raise against him seven shepherds, ⁵ and eight leaders of men. ⁶ They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, ⁶ and the land of Nimrod in its gates. ⁶ He will deliver us from the Assyrian, ⁶ when he invades our land, ⁶ and when he marches within our border. ⁷ The remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples, ⁷ like dew from Yahweh, ⁷ like showers on the grass, ⁷ that don’t wait for man, ⁷ nor wait for the sons of men. ⁸ The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, ⁸ among many peoples, ⁸ like a lion among the animals of the forest, ⁸ like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; ⁸ who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, ⁸ and there is no one to deliver. ⁹ Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, ⁹ and let all of your enemies be cut off. ¹⁰ “It will happen in that day”, says Yahweh, ¹⁰ “that I will cut off your horses out from among you, ¹⁰ and will destroy your chariots. ¹¹ I will cut off the cities of your land, ¹¹ and will tear down all your strongholds. ¹² I will destroy witchcraft from your hand; ¹² and you shall have no soothsayers. ¹³ I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out from among you; ¹³ and you shall no more worship the work of your hands. ¹⁴ I will uproot your Asherah poles out from among you; ¹⁴ and I will destroy your cities. ¹⁵ I will execute vengeance in anger, ¹⁵ and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.” # Micah 6

#### ¹ Listen now to what Yahweh says: 


#### ¹ “Arise, plead your case before the mountains, 
#### ¹ and let the hills hear what you have to say. ² Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s controversy, ² and you enduring foundations of the earth; ² for Yahweh has a controversy with his people, ² and he will contend with Israel. ³ My people, what have I done to you? ³ How have I burdened you? ³ Answer me! ⁴ For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, ⁴ and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. ⁴ I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. ⁵ My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, ⁵ and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, ⁵ that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.” ⁶ How shall I come before Yahweh, ⁶ and bow myself before the exalted God? ⁶ Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, ⁶ with calves a year old? ⁷ Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams? ⁷ With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? ⁷ Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? ⁷ The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? ⁸ He has shown you, O man, what is good. ⁸ What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly, ⁸ to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? ⁹ Yahweh’s voice calls to the city, ⁹ and wisdom sees your name: ⁹ “Listen to the rod, ⁹ and he who appointed it. ¹⁰ Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, ¹⁰ and a short ephah that is accursed? ¹¹ Shall I be pure with dishonest scales, ¹¹ and with a bag of deceitful weights? ¹² Her rich men are full of violence, ¹² her inhabitants speak lies, ¹² and their tongue is deceitful in their speech. ¹³ Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound. ¹³ I have made you desolate because of your sins. ¹⁴ You shall eat, but not be satisfied. ¹⁴ Your humiliation will be within you. ¹⁴ You will store up, but not save; ¹⁴ and that which you save I will give up to the sword. ¹⁵ You will sow, but won’t reap. ¹⁵ You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; ¹⁵ and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine. ¹⁶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, ¹⁶ and all the works of Ahab’s house. ¹⁶ You walk in their counsels, ¹⁶ that I may make you a ruin, ¹⁶ and her inhabitants a hissing; ¹⁶ And you will bear the reproach of my people.” # Micah 7

#### ¹ Misery is mine! 
#### ¹ Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard: 
#### ¹ There is no cluster of grapes to eat. 
#### ¹ My soul desires to eat the early fig. ² The godly man has perished out of the earth, ² and there is no one upright among men. ² They all lie in wait for blood; ² every man hunts his brother with a net. ³ Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. ³ The ruler and judge ask for a bribe; ³ and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul. ³ Thus they conspire together. ⁴ The best of them is like a brier. ⁴ The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. ⁴ The day of your watchmen, ⁴ even your visitation, has come; ⁴ now is the time of their confusion. ⁵ Don’t trust in a neighbor. ⁵ Don’t put confidence in a friend. ⁵ With the woman lying in your embrace, ⁵ be careful of the words of your mouth! ⁶ For the son dishonors the father, ⁶ the daughter rises up against her mother, ⁶ the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; ⁶ a man’s enemies are the men of his own house. ⁷ But as for me, I will look to Yahweh. ⁷ I will wait for the God of my salvation. ⁷ My God will hear me. ⁸ Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy. ⁸ When I fall, I will arise. ⁸ When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me. ⁹ I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, ⁹ because I have sinned against him, ⁹ until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me. ⁹ He will bring me out to the light. ⁹ I will see his righteousness. ¹⁰ Then my enemy will see it, ¹⁰ and shame will cover her who said to me, ¹⁰ where is Yahweh your God? ¹⁰ Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame. ¹⁰ Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets. ¹¹ A day to build your walls— ¹¹ In that day, he will extend your boundary. ¹² In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, ¹² and from Egypt even to the River, ¹² and from sea to sea, ¹² and mountain to mountain. ¹³ Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein, ¹³ for the fruit of their doings. ¹⁴ Shepherd your people with your staff, ¹⁴ the flock of your heritage, ¹⁴ who dwell by themselves in a forest, ¹⁴ in the middle of fertile pasture land, let them feed; ¹⁴ in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. ¹⁵ “As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt, ¹⁵ I will show them marvelous things.” ¹⁶ The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might. ¹⁶ They will lay their hand on their mouth. ¹⁶ Their ears will be deaf. ¹⁷ They will lick the dust like a serpent. ¹⁷ Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens. ¹⁷ They will come with fear to Yahweh our God, ¹⁷ and will be afraid because of you. ¹⁸ Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity, ¹⁸ and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? ¹⁸ He doesn’t retain his anger forever, ¹⁸ because he delights in loving kindness. ¹⁹ He will again have compassion on us. ¹⁹ He will tread our iniquities under foot; ¹⁹ and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. ²⁰ You will give truth to Jacob, ²⁰ and mercy to Abraham, ²⁰ as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
